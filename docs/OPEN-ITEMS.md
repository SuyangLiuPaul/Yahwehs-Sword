# OPEN-ITEMS.md — what is not done

One register for everything outstanding: bugs, unfinished work, decisions
waiting on the owner, and operational landmines. Written 2026-09-04 for a
handover, because the answer to "is all of it written down?" was **no** —
several items below appeared in no document in this repository at all.

**Every item carries a verification status.** `[verified 2026-09-04]`
means it was checked against the tree on that date. `[carried forward]`
means it comes from an earlier note and the check has NOT been redone —
treat those as leads, not facts, and verify before acting. Nothing here
is asserted more strongly than it was checked.

**A `[verified]` tag is a claim like any other.** A 2026-09-05 re-read
found two entries listing shipped work as open — one of them carrying a
`[verified 2026-09-04]` tag it had not earned. Both are struck, with
their evidence, under *Withdrawn* at the foot of this file. Every other
`[verified 2026-09-04]` tag here was re-checked against the tree on
2026-09-05 and still holds; the dates are left as first checked.

**That last sentence did not survive the afternoon, and the way it
failed is the more useful lesson.** A second 2026-09-05 pass found two
more entries wrong. The `main.dart` O4 items were re-checked *against
the tree* and passed, because the code they name does still exist — what
had changed was that it had been reworked on 2026-09-02/03 under
different names, and re-reading the entry alongside the code would have
caught what re-grepping for its nouns could not. The strip lane-heading
entry passed because its supporting test passed, and the test was
measuring the **Flutter test font**, in which every glyph is a full em
box: the 221 px it reported was 17 characters × 13 px, roughly double
the truth for Latin, and it named the one English heading with room to
spare. **A green test is not a measurement of the shipped app**, and
`[verified]` should say what instrument was used.

`PROJECT_STATE.md` remains the queue for work being actively scheduled.
This file is the complete picture, including things nobody has scheduled.

## Current release gates and source decisions — 2026-10-01

**Latest distribution checkpoint:** [1.7.3 delivery](delivery-1.7.3-2026-10-01.md) and [Microsoft package guard](microsoft-followup-1.7.3.md) supersede the older store versions below. GitHub/web1.7.3 is released, Google closed Alpha1.7.3 is available, Apple1.7.3 builds are processed, and Microsoft submission4 is pending. Keep the entries below as dated evidence; do not upload an older queued package.


These checks supersede earlier release-preparation statements; the older bug and parity entries remain individually dated and are not closed by a green release.

- **Apple beta approval `[open; checked 2026-10-01]`:** replacement iOS **1.6.330 (1060331)** delivered/complete after **1060330** failed **ITMS-90683**; PR #5 purpose-string repair merged with green CI **36728390165** and one regression test. External Public beta remains **Waiting for Review**. Compliance is complete and internal Sword group has one assigned tester. Mac **1.6.330 (1060330)** delivered with external beta **Waiting for Review** and internal group assigned.
- **Public App Store review `[open; checked 2026-10-01]`:** existing **iOS 1.6.328 / Mac 1.6.329 Waiting for Review** submissions preserved. Do not cancel them to force the newer beta builds through.
- **Google review / production qualification `[open; checked 2026-10-01]`:** closed-track **1.6.330 / 2000004 Available to selected testers (released 1 October 00:37)**, managed publishing off; **8 opted in**, production access still requires **12 testers / 14 days**.
- **Microsoft certification / queued update `[open; checked 2026-10-01 00:32 Melbourne]`:** submission **3 In certification**. Keep three languages, copy and screenshots. **1.6.330.0 x64 MSIX** is prepared by green run **36723331684**, with existing identity/publisher, at `/Users/pliu0036/Downloads/store-windows/sword-1.6.330/Yahwehs-Sword-msix/yahwehs_sword.msix`; existing Sword daily heartbeat follows up after current approval. No duplicate submission was made.
- **BIB source conflict `[open; measured 2026-09-30]`:** **1 Corinthians 7:15** source hyperlink and tooltip disagree on Strong's number; importer leaves it unassigned. Manifest preserves the evidence. No theological or numerical guess is authorized by the corpus validation.
- **Commentary editorial decision `[open; reviewed 2026-09-30]`:** EV explicit **Thayer G2304 / Strong SCh H7307**, interpretive **Thayer G1504**, and separate CBOL findings are in `eaglesview-theology-review.md` / `.json`. Findings do not establish that all EV material is doctrinally endorsed; originals were not silently rewritten.
- **Physical verification `[unverified]`:** actual physical Windows, car and watch behavior was not verified. Car/watch features belong to Words; Sword has no Firebase and this release makes no Sword CarPlay claim.

**Completed distribution facts:** tag **v1.6.330**, six GitHub assets, and dev/prod **1.6.330** web deployments are complete; release analysis clean, full suite **5,923 passed / 10 existing skips / 0 failed**. These facts establish the release, not store approval or closure of the entire register. Original shared checkout synchronization preserves dirty work and has backup `Downloads/Yahweh-workspace-sync-backup-20261001/manifest.json`. Full evidence/paths: `release-2026-09-30.md` and newest `HANDOFF.md`.

## Bugs

### The reading pane renders no verses when the book's language and the version's corpus disagree `[CLOSED 2026-09-05 — every path walked]`

The register kept this as a lead with the note "not verified in this
pass". It was verified on 2026-09-05, by walking every writer of
`currentVersion` and `currentBook` rather than by reading the pane. The
pane was never the place: `bible_reading_pane.dart` filters by
`currentBook` and is right to: what could be wrong is whoever set it.

| path that can cross a language boundary | how it is answered | since |
|---|---|---|
| the version menu, cold path | `setVersion` → `_realignBookTo` | pre-existing |
| the version menu, warm cache | `translateBookName(prevEn, version)` before `setCurrentChapter` (`bible_reading_pane.dart`) | pre-existing |
| a shared link with `?v=` | `_applyHashToState` swaps the version FIRST, then translates and verifies the chapter exists | v1.3.61 |
| boot, restoring a saved book | `_realignBookTo(currentVersion)` **after** the saved book lands | 2026-09-05 |
| the workbench's second column | `_followPrimary`, matched through English | v1.6.47 |
| **Split View's second column (`home_page.dart`)** | **it did not** — see below | fixed 2026-09-05 |

The boot row is the one that made this reproducible without touching a
version menu at all: `_realignBookTo` used to be called inside
`restoreState`'s `savedVersion != null` branch, where `currentBook` is
still null, so its own first line returned every time and the boot path
realigned nothing. An `en`-locale reader carrying the old default
(`cuvs-yhwh`, books keyed 创世纪) through the v1.3.46 migration got
`bsb` with 创世纪 still in hand, and `versesInChapter('创世纪', 1)`
matches nothing in a corpus keyed on Genesis — a blank pane on the first
frame after an upgrade.

The last row is the same defect one surface further out, found the same
day and not previously written down anywhere. `_activateSplitView`
seeded the second column with `sp.verses.firstWhere((v) => v.book ==
primary.currentBook && …, orElse: () => sp.verses.first)` — a RAW
comparison between two editions' book names. Measured on the shipped
assets, `cuvs-yhwh.json` keys 31,102 verses on 创世纪 / 约翰福音 and
`bsb.json` (31,086), `kjv.json` (31,102) and `leb.json` (31,199) key
theirs on Genesis / John, so it matched nothing whenever the columns
were in different languages — which is the case Split View is FOR — and
the `orElse` then answered Genesis 1. A reader on 约翰福音 3 got a second
column on Genesis 1, scrolled to Genesis 1:16 by the verse-number
restore. The rule now lives in `lib/utils/chapter_across_editions.dart`
and both split surfaces call it;
`test/chapter_across_editions_test.dart` pins the rule. It also reads
both pages' source, and on 2026-09-06 that half was measured against
the defect restored with its operands reversed (`pb == v.book`) and one
mention of the shared function left in a comment: **all three
assertions passed**. That sentence — "pins the rule and the wiring" —
is what let the group go unexamined, which is why it is quoted here
rather than deleted.

Rewritten: comments are stripped before matching, each call is anchored
in an assignment, and `isNot(contains('<exact old text>'))` is now
disallowed outright in that file — it is a blacklist of one item from
an infinite set, defeated by reordering operands, renaming a local, or
running the formatter.

It still cannot prove behaviour. The real pin is a test that drives
`_activateSplitView` — SharedPreferences plus two parsed corpora plus a
layout pass — and it does not exist. A repo-wide `grep -n "isNot(contains" test/`
is a cheap follow-up: only the two files touched that day were swept.

Not shown on a device. Everything above is read from the tree and from
the assets, and the *symptom* was reported on prod; if it recurs, the
list of paths above is what to re-walk.

### The verse picker can open on a stale chapter `[CLOSED 2026-09-05]`

It did share the bug, and it was neither of the two causes YsWords
found. `currentVerse` is the workspace cursor and the reading pane's
header opens the picker at `currentVerse.book` / `.chapter`, not at
`currentBook` / `currentChapter`. Every in-app caller of
`setCurrentChapter` pairs it with `updateCurrentVerse`; one did not —
`url_sync_service_web.dart` moves the reference from a hash and touches
the cursor only when the link carried a `:verse`. So a chapter-only
link, and browser Back or Forward onto a chapter-only history entry,
moved the reference and left the cursor behind, and the reader's own
`PageView` could not repair it because `onPageChanged`'s
`if (idx == currentChapterPageIdx) return` gate fires against a provider
that has already moved.

Fixed in the provider rather than at either end, so no future caller can
perform half the move: `MainProvider._settleCursorInCurrentChapter`,
pinned by `test/chapter_cursor_settle_test.dart`.

### Two English lane headings truncated on the strip at phone width `[FIXED 2026-09-05 — and the old entry was wrong]`

**The 2026-09-04 entry named the wrong heading and its number was an
artefact.** It said `Genesis lifespans` "wants 221 px, which is 59% of a
375 px screen". 221 is 17 characters × 13 px: it was measured under the
**Flutter test font**, in which every glyph — Latin or Han — is a full em
box. That is correct for Han, which really is one em per glyph, so the
Chinese half of `test/strip_header_column_test.dart` was sound by
accident; it is roughly double the truth for Latin, and the test's
English assertion was a false witness that passed.

Re-measured 2026-09-05 in the bundled Roboto at the size and weight the
painter actually draws (`headingFontPx` = 12 × 1.15 = 13.8,
`FontWeight.w600`), against the 134 px a heading gets inside the 150 px
column at 375 px:

| heading | width | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `Events` | 41.3 | fits |
| `Genesis lifespans` | 109.6 | fits, 24 px spare — **the entry's example was the one heading with room** |
| `Prophets & apostles` | 124.7 | fits |
| `Peoples & institutions` | 135.5 | **over by 1.5** |
| `Kings of Judah & Israel` | 142.9 | **over by 8.9** |

So it was two headings, and neither of them the one on record.

**The wording decision the entry was waiting on has been taken** (ruling
by Fable 5.1, 2026-09-05, on the measurements above):

> At default type on a 375 px phone the sticky lane column gives a
> heading 134 px, and measured in the bundled Roboto face two English
> headings overflow it: "Kings of Judah & Israel" (142.9 px) and
> "Peoples & institutions" (135.5 px); the earlier claim that "Genesis
> lifespans" truncated came from the Flutter test font and was wrong.
> The kings heading becomes "Judah & Israel kings" (125.3 px) because
> the kingdom names are drawn nowhere else on the strip — the two
> sub-lanes differ only by hue — while "Judah & Israel" alone would
> duplicate two band names in the streams group directly below. The
> streams heading becomes "Peoples" because no wording containing
> "institutions" fits with margin, "powers" would be false for the
> Scripture and Elsewhere bands, and the three non-people bands carry
> their own names in the lane, so the dropped word is recoverable in
> place. Chinese strings and the other three English headings fit and
> are unchanged; candidates under ~8 px of Roboto margin were rejected
> because the default font is the system face, and the ellipsis remains
> the backstop for reader-chosen wider fonts.

Applied in `lib/constants/strip_strings.dart`.
`test/strip_header_column_test.dart` now loads the faces this app ships
(Roboto, Noto Sans SC) and requires 8 px of clearance rather than
asserting a truncation.

**Still open, small:** the ruling notes the kings heading clears by 8.7
px in Roboto, which is at the threshold, and asks for one re-measure in
San Francisco before this is called finished. No test can do that — the
system face is not a file in this repo — so it needs a screenshot of the
strip on the iPhone at 375 px.

## Unfinished features

### The chart index is closed — 786 headwords, not 784, and none undispositioned `[measured 2026-09-05]`

**Neither number in the old entry reproduces**, and the per-section
figures it listed (Israel 80, Americas 56, …) do not reproduce against
any file in the audit either.

The index has **786** distinct headwords — `extract/index.merged.tsv`,
885 rows → 833 non-`?` → 786 distinct, the same under case-folding and
NFKC, and the audit's own `DRAWN-LAYER.md` says 786 too (its `README.md`
says 794, also wrong). Every one is covered, placed, or refused with a
stated reason across the five index passes, and **196 of the 197 records
those passes proposed had already shipped**; the one that had not (the
judges era as a band) shipped 2026-09-05.

**How the number got here matters more than the number.** The 462 was
written at 2026-09-03 08:25. Three of the passes that closed it ran
*later the same day* — 15:41, 15:59, 19:04. This register was created the
next morning and carried the figure forward under `[verified 2026-09-04]`.
The tag was false: the number was copied, not re-measured. That is the
failure mode this whole file exists to prevent, and it happened on the
day the file was written.

**What is actually open is the annulus, and it now has a price.** The
Sirach prologue (132 BC, the earliest witness to a threefold Hebrew
canon) was fully researched and written and is deliberately NOT on the
wheel: adding it takes `wheel_label_legibility_test.dart` to **61 whole
Chinese names at 900 px against a floor of 62**, and dropping either
modern 2026-09-05 addition instead does not recover it — the crowding is
at 132 BC. Its absence is now an assertion in
`test/wheel_coverage_2026_09_05_test.dart`. The floor is what has to move
first, and `wheel_label_legibility_test.dart` says so in its own words.

### The wheel was drawing four events twice `[verified 2026-09-05]`

Found by the same pass, all four shipped and all four green under 4,470
tests: `einstein_relativity`/`special_relativity` (both 1905, on
different rings), `wright_first_flight`/`powered_flight` (both 1903
Kitty Hawk), `movable_type_china` 1040 / `bi_sheng_movable_type` 1045
(**same ring**, and 1040 falls outside the 1041–1048 window Shen Kuo —
the only source either cites — actually gives), and a record titled
"Columbus Reaches the Americas" whose id and description say Columbian
Exchange, dated to a round 1500 that no reference states.

De-duplicated: events 747 → 745, powers 226 → 231. **This is the "a green
suite is not a legible screen" trap in its data form** — no test can see
that two records describe one event, and none did.

### `main.dart`'s three O4 items — all three answered `[re-checked 2026-09-05]`

The cold `#/wheel` that only began loading its 131 KB asset at push time
is fixed. **The other two were re-checked on 2026-09-05 and the entry
above them was stale**: both had been reworked on 2026-09-02/03, and the
reason a grep for them came back empty is that neither lives under the
name this entry gave it.

- **The boot-page latch is gone, deliberately.** `_applyHashToState`
  used to record the boot path so `main()` could re-open the page after
  the splash. A page path is an INITIAL ROUTE now
  (`appGenerateRoute`), created by the Navigator once per document at
  the first frame, and the recording API was deleted along with the
  post-splash push — so a cold-open push cannot quietly come back
  without someone re-adding it.
- **The early return on popstate still exists, and is now the
  documented rule rather than an accident.** It is
  `urlMayDriveReader(path:, isBoot:, claimedPath:)` in
  `lib/utils/url_claim.dart`, a pure function with two stated reasons
  to refuse a hash (it names a page, not a passage; or a page owns the
  address bar, which is what browser Back off the wheel delivers) and
  an explicit exemption for boot, which is the one apply that must not
  be droppable. `test/url_claim_test.dart` covers it.

Nothing here is open. Left in the file rather than struck, because
"O4 item 2 and 3" is how these are referred to elsewhere and a reader
who finds the old phrasing needs to land somewhere.

## Decisions waiting on the owner

- **The NASB.** Shipped in the assets but hidden — `disabledVersions` is
  `{nasb}` and nothing else. The text is FROZEN: a defect in it gets
  reported, never corrected. Whether it can be shown at all is a
  licensing question nobody has answered. `[verified 2026-09-04]`
- **Whether the Reader becomes a workbench mode** rather than a separate
  surface. `[carried forward]`
- **Shortening the English strip lane headings** (above).
- ~~**Target size on the Workbench.**~~ `[CLOSED 2026-09-14 — two
  sizes, chosen by input device]` 73 of 105 tappable nodes were under
  24px in at least one dimension, measured by pumping `WorkbenchPage` at
  1280x900 and reading each rendered control. On a pointer that is the
  brief — "a dense, flat, neutral, keyboard-driven desktop tool", and the
  2026-09-07 note says density did not change — so the desktop is
  untouched and is asserted to stay dense. On Android and the iPad, where
  WCAG 2.5.8 applies and the same widgets ship, nothing is under 24px any
  more. `WbMetrics.minTarget` carries the rule and why it is 24 rather
  than Apple's 44 or Material's 48; `test/touch_target_test.dart`
  measures both platforms and fails either way round.
  Three things had to move for one rule to work: the shared chrome box,
  the four chrome STRIP heights (a 24px control cannot live in a 21px
  strip — the strip's height becomes the child's maximum), and three
  widgets that draw their own controls outside that box. The only targets
  left under 24 on touch are the two pane dividers, which 2.5.8 exempts
  as essential: a divider's size is its position, and it is 16px across
  and 824 long.

- ~~**Whether the reading column should be capped on a wide monitor.**~~
  `[CLOSED 2026-09-14 — wired up, not deleted]`
  `ResponsiveBreakpoints.maxContentWidth` had forty lines of rationale
  and no caller. It is now read by the verse column in
  `bible_reading_pane.dart` — the column only, not the pane frame, so a
  pane's own title strip and status line still run the full width of
  their column and the workspace does not grow gutters. It binds on one
  surface, the Reader centre mode at full width on a large display; in
  Browse and Split every column is already far under the cap.
  `test/reading_measure_test.dart` pins both halves, including that no
  workbench column width is ever narrowed by it.

## Operational landmines

### The iOS provisioning profile expires weekly `[verified 2026-09-04]`

Free tier. The profile for `com.example.yahwehswords` was issued
2026-09-04 and expires **2026-09-10T23:44:06Z** (2026-09-11 AEST). When
it lapses the app stops launching on the iPhone and iPad and needs
`tools/release_native.sh` run again. Device registration itself persists.

### `tools/yswords-ios-reinstall.sh` builds the wrong app `[verified 2026-09-04]`

A fork leftover. Its `PROJECT=` is hardcoded to
`/Users/pliu0036/Documents/yswords`, so running it from this repository
builds and installs **YsWords**. Nothing invokes it — every other
mention of the filename is a comment. Delete it or repoint it; leaving
it is the hazard.

**Re-checked 2026-09-06, and it is worse than "wrong app".** Nothing
invokes it; **no launchd job anywhere points into this repo**; and the
copy here is 414 lines against the parent's current 1218 — a stale
snapshot rather than a script missing a footnote. There is also no test
guarding it: the `test/apk_freshness_guard_test.dart` that was believed
to lift functions out of it **does not exist and never has**
(`git log --all` finds nothing), so it is entirely free to change or
delete.

Ruled: delete. Repointing it would create a second hand-run install path
beside `tools/release_native.sh`, which already derives its project root
from its own location and cannot have this bug — and the TCC constraint
above means this file could never become the scheduled artifact anyway.
**Awaiting the owner's call**, because deleting a tool is a product
decision rather than a bug fix.

### ~~The native identity was never rebranded~~ `[REFUTED 2026-09-06]`

It was rebranded, on 2026-08-23, in `0def09c` — whose subject line says
so: *"feat: plain 'AI' labels + standalone native identity (Yahweh's
Swords)"*. That commit moved `com.example.yswords` to
`com.example.yahwehswords` across Android (namespace and applicationId),
iOS (six places) and macOS (xcconfig and both entitlements), and moved
`MainActivity.kt` between package directories.

Three ids, verified in each tree, no collision: Sword
`com.example.yahwehswords`, Words `com.example.yswords`, World
`com.yswords.yahwehsworld`. `README.md:126` is wrong twice about this —
it calls `com.example.yahwehswords` "YsWords' own app identity", which it
is not, and says the no-collision claim "was never actually true", which
it is. The display name is not a leftover either: `brand_marks_test.dart`
records SeekSparks as the RETIRED mark deliberately.

The only genuine residue is the `com.example.` template prefix, and it
must stay — Android treats a new applicationId as a different app and
changing it would orphan every installed copy.

### The English iOS home screen said "Yahweh's Swords" for twelve days `[FIXED 2026-09-06]`

Found while refuting the entry above, which is the useful part: the
rename to the singular (`8613b3a`, 2026-08-25, *"owner-requested,
singular"*) touched 11 files and **zero `.lproj` files**.

`ios/Runner/en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings` kept `"Yahweh's Swords"`. It
ships — `en` is in `knownRegions` and the file is in the
`InfoPlist.strings` variant group in the Resources phase — and on iOS a
localized `InfoPlist.strings` **overrides `Info.plist`**. So for twelve
days an English iPhone showed the plural on its home screen while the
Android phone beside it showed the singular.

This is the same failure class `brand_marks_test.dart` was written for,
one layer below where that test looks. `test/native_display_name_test.dart`
now guards all seven carriers, and restoring the plural fails two of them.

### No scheduled iOS reinstall for this app `[verified 2026-09-06]`

Both sibling apps have a daily launchd job; this one has none, and the
provisioning profile lapses every seven days — so the two items are the
same problem seen from two ends.

If one is ever set up, the script must live under
`~/.config/seeksparks/scripts/`, **not in this repo**: a plist comment in
the siblings records that launchd is TCC-blocked from reading
`~/Documents`, which is why both of them run copies from `~/.config/`.

### `LICENSE` states the sermons' rights but not their authorship `[revised 2026-09-05]`

**This entry overstated the problem and is corrected here.** It said the
notice "credits the wrong person". It does not: `© Liang Jia-keng, used
with permission` is a *rights* claim, and the comment above
`aboutLicenseSermons` (`lib/constants/ui_strings.dart:5030`) already
reasons this through — who preached and who holds the rights are two
different facts, and only the first is settled. Liang Jia-keng may well
be the party who granted permission, which would make the © line
correct. Nothing in the repo establishes it either way, and deleting a
rights claim on a guess is worse than carrying an unverified one.

What the notice was actually missing is the settled fact: the corpus was
built by `scripts/ingest_sermons.py` from Pastor Eric H.H. Chang's
(张熙和牧师) sermon tree, and every body file is his preaching — see
`lib/constants/sermon_credit.dart`. **Done 2026-09-05:** `LICENSE` now
states the authorship alongside the unchanged © line, and points at the
`ui_strings.dart` note.

**Still open, and needs the corpus owner, not a developer:** confirm
whether Liang Jia-keng is the rights holder / permission grantor for the
sermons. If he is not, both the `LICENSE` line and `aboutLicenseSermons`
(which is user-visible, in three locales) are wrong together and must
change together.

### ~~A scratch harness is committed into the test suite~~ `[CLOSED 2026-09-06]`

`test/zz_measure_test.dart` — 51 lines, zero `expect(`, two `print(`,
running on every CI job and unable to fail — is deleted (staged with
`git rm`, not committed).

Deleted rather than converted, because converting would have duplicated a
test that already exists: `wheel_lifespans_test.dart` asserts every
number this harness printed, as legibility FLOORS with reasons rather
than as a census. Floors are properties and survive data changes; a
census pinned to `hebrew_kings.json` would have collided with the kings
work landing the same day. Mutating `ringPitch` fails three of those
floors, which is the proof that deleting the harness lost nothing.

### `output/` is somebody else's work, sitting in this checkout `[verified 2026-09-05]`

3.7 MB in two files — `output/pdf/神要开道路_G调和弦版.pdf` and
`output/imagegen/神要开道路_G调和弦版.png` — a Chinese worship song's
chord chart. It is **not** this project's: the PDF names ReportLab as
its producer and stamps `D:20260811144203+10'00'`, matching both files'
mtimes, and `reportlab`, `imagegen` and the song title appear nowhere in
this repository. Some other tool ran with this checkout as its working
directory and left its output behind.

It was untracked **and unignored**, which in a shared checkout is one
careless `git add` from being committed. `.gitignore` now covers
`output/`, with the same explanation. Nothing was deleted or moved —
it is the owner's document. **Move it somewhere it belongs and delete

### The chart audit lives outside this repository `[carried forward]`

Roughly 25 unresolved judgement calls from the printed-chart audit are
in `~/Documents/CodingProject/SeekSparks-chart-audit/`, which is **not
under git**. It is not backed up by anything this repository does. The
source chart is under active copyright: it is used as a coverage
checklist only, every fact is re-sourced independently, and its wording
is never copied or quoted.

### "Three of the Eagle's View imports have no user interface"

Listed 2026-09-04 as `[verified]`; **false**, and two of the three
already had UI when the tag was written, so the tag was never earned.

| import | where the reader reaches it | landed |
|---|---|---|
| Thayer's lexicon | `lib/widgets/word_analysis_pane.dart:38` (`ThayerService`), plus its own screen `lib/pages/lexicon_page.dart`, pushed from `lib/pages/workbench_page.dart:614` | `70bd2ae` 2026-08-07; the Lexicon Browser `1542a74` / `1db3890` 2026-08-23 |
| Bible names (Hitchcock) | inline in `lib/widgets/word_analysis_pane.dart` — lookup `:184`, render `:518`, attribution `:619` | `70bd2ae` 2026-08-07 |
| Places | `lib/widgets/places_pane.dart` is an analysis tab (`workbench_page.dart:2540`); `lib/pages/atlas_page.dart` is pushed from `workbench_page.dart:332`, `:597` and `:2551` | pane `55772db` 2026-08-08, atlas `4f4858a` 2026-08-09, journeys `80ca89d` 2026-09-01 |

### "The Modern Concordance was never imported"

Carried forward unchecked; **false**. It was imported in two deliberate
stages, which is why a single-script check missed it:

1. `tools/import_eaglesview_modern_concordance.py` writes to
   `build/restricted/` and *refuses* to write under `assets/` without
   `--acknowledge-rights` (script lines 197-200). Landed `790edba`
   2026-08-07.
2. `tools/build_concordance_assets.py` joins that blob into
   `assets/concordance/`. Landed `34bef43` 2026-08-07, together with
   the assets and the service.

370 files under `assets/concordance/` are tracked in git, declared at
`pubspec.yaml:148-150`, read by `lib/services/modern_concordance_service.dart`,
and surfaced as the Topics tab (`lib/widgets/analysis_tabs.dart:306`,
`:1202`).

---

### Both withdrawals above are correct. The instrument behind them was not. `[2026-09-05]`

They were checked the way `docs/PARITY-BACKLOG.md` checks this axis — on
disk / declared in `pubspec.yaml` / referenced from `lib/` — and **that
stops at the service boundary**. A service can be referenced while a
whole public branch of it is dead.

Re-checked per MEMBER, three Eagle's View data branches had **no caller
anywhere in `lib/`**:

| orphan | what the reader lost |
|---|---|
| `ModernConcordanceService.topics()` | the entire 341-topic index — no entry by topic name, dead since `34bef43` |
| `GreekStatsService.books()` + `BookVocabulary` | the 27-book profile, **and the AOSurvey attribution**, which is assigned nowhere else |
| `SynopsisService.byVerse` | verse-level OT parallels — found by the new ratchet on the day it was written |

So "three of the Eagle's View imports have no user interface" was **false
as written and pointing at something real one level down**. The count was
right by accident.

The second one is a rights defect rather than a cosmetic gap: four of the
five Eagle's View reference imports render their credit, and the fifth —
**the one that is permission-granted rather than public domain** — had
the empty string.

Disposition: the concordance index is closed by
`lib/pages/modern_concordance_page.dart`; the 27-book table is DECLINED
with reasons (`stats_page.dart` already prints per-book running words and
distinct lemmas for all 66 books from the app's own tagged text, so a
second table would restate two columns with *different* numbers); the
verse-level synopsis stays open. All three are recorded in
`test/data_surface_reachability_test.dart`, which fails if any regresses.

**One measurement worth keeping**: 239 of the 341 concordance names are
compounds (`Catch - Seize - Steal`), so Nave's whole-headword prefix rule
answers `seize` with **zero**. Matching had to be per-segment and
bilingual — `爱` reaches 3 topics no English query finds.

### Every overflow test in the repo asked at one interface size `[FIXED 2026-09-14]`

`test/responsive_overflow_smoke_test.dart` laid four pages out at 320 /
390 / 768 / 1280 and asserted nothing threw. It ran every one of them at
menu scale **1.0** and reader size **20**, and both sliders go higher —
Menu Size to 1.5x, the reader's own text to 40. Chrome sizes come from
`fontSize.clamp(16, 28) * menuScale`, so the largest interface this app
can draw was the one configuration never laid out.

Added as a paired axis — `default 1.0x / 20pt` and `largest 1.5x / 40pt`,
because the clamp only saturates at the top of the *font* slider and both
had to be up — and it found three clipped rows immediately:

| row | width | overflow | what was off the screen |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WorkbenchMenuBar` | 320 | 45px | 帮助 and the build label — the **first row on the screen** |
| `BrowseNavStrip` | 320 | 13px | the verse dropdown |
| `AboutPage` contact heading | 390 | 47px | 「版权下架请求」 — the takedown half of the line |

The two strips got `OverflowHintScroll`, which is this repo's existing
answer and already carries the toolbar (2026-09-14, earlier): the strip
fades the edge that has more behind it and puts a chevron there. `minWidth`
is the viewport, so nothing moves at any width where the row already fits
— every desktop size this tool is designed for. The About heading got
`Expanded`; the card above it already wrapped its title that way.

A four-line clause, not a redesign: the brief is "a dense, flat, neutral,
keyboard-driven desktop tool", and none of these shrink a target or hide
a command.

**Found in the Words repo first**, where the same missing axis was hiding
a 64px overflow in the reading page's bottom bar — the screen a reader
spends every minute on. Both repos now carry the axis.

#### Two labels truncated at that corner `[FIXED 2026-09-14, having first been recorded and left]`

A sweep for `maxLines: 1` + `TextOverflow.ellipsis` paragraphs drawn
narrower than their own text, at 320/390 with both sliders at maximum:

| label | short by | what the reader saw |
|---|---|---|
| `关于与版权说明 · v1.6.276` (About app bar) | 142px | 「关于与版...」 — the version number gone |
| `创世纪 1  —  雅简+ · 梁简 · BSB-Y` (pane title) | 221px | the reference; the whole edition stack gone |

**The first disposition was to leave them**, on the grounds that both cut
from the right with the important half on the left, and that no reader had
reported either. That was wrong on the facts in both cases, and the owner
asking for them anyway is what made me go and look:

* the version is in the About app bar **because** the footer is six
  sections down a `ListView` and nobody scrolls to it (v1.2.19). The
  ellipsis was deleting the one thing the line exists to carry — and the
  ellipsis had been added in v1.2.22 *for this exact case*, which is a
  neat illustration of a fix that stops the striped band and leaves the
  defect.
* the pane title is not a caption. It names the edition stack **and is
  the control for changing it**, so what the ellipsis deleted is what the
  control is currently set to.

Both shrink instead, through `FittedBox(fit: BoxFit.scaleDown)`, which
only ever shrinks — at every width where the line already fits, which is
every desktop size this tool is designed for, nothing moves. The ellipsis
stays underneath as the floor. The pane title also folds its stack to
`雅简+ +2` on a screen too narrow to name it, using the same
`_isThreePane` line the bars use to decide what goes in them rather than
a second threshold that would drift from the first.

`test/chrome_label_truncation_test.dart` is the guard, and it is the
companion the overflow grid never had: same pages, same widths, but
measuring paragraphs instead of watching for exceptions. Its allow-list
holds exactly one entry — verse text, which is prose and belongs to the
reader — and it carries a case that puts a clipped label in front of the
walk, so a change that stopped the walk finding anything cannot turn the
file green.

### The update notice was a six-second bar at the foot of the screen `[FIXED 2026-09-14]`

「如果有 upgrade available 应该在 home page 显示而不是最下面 popup」, with
雅伟的话 named as the reference. Everything wrong with the old shape was
the shape rather than the words: a `SnackBar` arrives while the reader is
opening the app, sits at the bottom edge furthest from what they are
looking at, and then takes the fact away again, leaving nothing to come
back to but a tile on the About page nothing points at.

`UpdateAvailableBanner` sits under the toolbar instead — one row, the
version, one action, and a 暂不 that means "not this build" rather than
"never again", so the next release gets through. It calls the same
`canInstallInApp` / `installUpdateInApp` pair the About dialog calls,
which is the half of the SnackBar worth keeping (2026-09-09 finding 6);
`buildUpdateAvailableBar` is deleted rather than left for a second caller
to find, and a source-level test says so, because two surfaces for one
fact is how those two drifted apart in the first place.

#### The interval is the reader's now

`updateCheckDueAt` compared against a compiled `const Duration(days: 1)`
and the only control over it was a switch. `UpdateCheckFrequency` — every
launch / daily / weekly / monthly — is stored as a written-out
`prefValue`, not an index (which breaks when a value is inserted) and not
`name` (which ties a stored preference to a Dart identifier). Anything
unrecognised reads as daily, which is also still the default and still
what the switch turns on; the switch's label stopped saying 每天 in both
apps, because a switch promising daily above a 每周 selection is the
interface lying.

`runDailyUpdateCheck` is `runScheduledUpdateCheck`. The name was accurate
and stopped being so.

Tests, in both repos: the full interval table asserted a minute either
side of each gap (a wrong `gap` shows up as the adjacent row's answer), a
weekly reader not asked on any of the six days inside the week, the switch
still beating every interval, the choice surviving a reload, an unknown
stored value reading as daily, and every enum value having a label in all
three locales — that last one derived from `UpdateCheckFrequency.values`
rather than a key list, so a fifth frequency cannot ship unlabelled.

#### Asking now, without waiting for the interval `[2026-09-14]`

The sibling Words app answers 「往下拉 ... 就会等于manual sync一下 并且自动
检查最新更新」 with a `RefreshIndicator` on its home screen. This app has
no such screen to pull: the workspace is panes, and the one scrollable
thing on it is the reading column, where a pull already means the
previous chapter. So the same request lands where a desktop tool puts it
— **Help ▸ Check for updates** — which is also, until today, the only way
to ask at all without walking into the About page.

It skips the two gates that exist to stop the app asking on its OWN (the
reader's interval and the automatic-check switch) and still stamps the
timestamp, so asking by hand spends the period. It is the one place in
this feature that **speaks when there is nothing to report**, in a dialog
rather than the banner: a reader who asks a direct question and is told
nothing cannot tell "you are current" from "the check is broken", which
is the failure this whole feature exists to end.

**There is no sync half here, and that is not an omission.** This app has
no account and no cloud sync — `url_sync_service.dart` is about URL
state, not a profile — so there is nothing for a manual sync to push.

### The launch notice about a retired edition is gone `[FIXED 2026-09-14]`

Reported twice. The first time — 「为什么有提示 BSB Y 不能提供？不应该有
这个任何 popup 啊」 — was answered on 2026-09-09 by making it fire once per
retired code instead of on every launch. **That answered the wrong half.**
The owner's sentence has two clauses and the second is the argument: *they
had not asked for anything*. A saved preference is not a request. The
reader chose BSB once, months ago; the catalogue changed under them; the
app opens the successor, which is right and needs no announcement.

Once-per-code is also still every launch to anyone reading in a **private
window**, which is how it came back — the second report is a screenshot of
sword.yahwehword.com in Safari private browsing.

So the boot path says nothing now. **The URL path still speaks, and must**:
a shared link or bookmark NAMES an edition, and opening a different one
without saying so would answer a question the reader actually asked with a
silent substitution. Nothing is hidden either way — the edition is in the
status bar, the pane title and the version pill on every screen.

Three tests changed sides, including one whose stated reason was "a silent
swap reads as the app forgetting their choice". That was a reasonable
thing to believe and the owner has now said otherwise twice.

### On a phone, the bottom bar could not escape the chart `[FIXED 2026-09-14]`

「手机上按这个按道理应该自动关闭这个画面 很多其他page也一样因为手机跟大
屏幕不一样」, from an iPhone with the word-distribution chart open.

`_buildPhonePane` checks `_chartStrongs` **before** the three-way switch —
deliberately, and `workbench_phone_reach_test.dart` requires it, because
the wide layout puts the chart ahead of the centre mode in the same way.
On a phone that made the chart outrank the only navigation there is: the
tap moved `_phonePane` and the screen did not change, so Read looked like
a dead control.

Choosing a destination now clears what is standing in front of the panes,
through `_closePhoneOverlays`. A wide screen is unaffected — the chart has
a pane of its own there and this bar does not exist.

The guard is the **pairing**, not the field: any state that short-circuits
`_buildPhonePane` ahead of the switch must be something
`_closePhoneOverlays` clears. A second such surface fails the test until it
joins. (It strips comments before scanning — the method's own note names
`_openChart` and `_closeChart` while explaining the history, and a rule
that reads prose cannot tell a mention from a use.)

### Adopting the official 和合本雅偉版 — measured, built, and NOT shipped `[2026-09-14]`

「繁体版也adopt yahwehdehua他们的版本 ... 因为那边才是正式的」, and 「梁也要
更新最新版本」. The ruling is right and the tools are here
(`tools/adopt_official_cuv.py`, and `tools/adopt_official_ljk.py` in the
Words repo). The assets are NOT adopted, because running it in full
proved something that changes what "adopt" has to mean.

**The official Traditional is a conversion, and this repo's is a set of
decisions.** `tools/export-app-db.py` on the official side records
`bible_cuvt` as built by `tools/tc` — OpenCC plus scripture corrections —
from the official Simplified. OpenCC must guess the one-to-many cases
(干 → 乾/幹, 谷 → 谷/穀, 发 → 發/髮, 面 → 面/麵) and it guesses wrong where
this repo has already settled it, verse by verse, with a test each:
創世紀 41's lean cows are **乾瘦**; the official text says **幹瘦**.

A wholesale adoption turned about 110 tests red in the sibling Words
repo, and they are not stale guards:

| what failed | what it protects |
|---|---|
| ~20 `traditional_*_glyph_test.dart` | one-to-many 简→繁 choices checked against the Hebrew |
| `cuv_typo_corruptions_test` | name spellings — 朵多, 帖土羅 — unanimous here, inconsistent there. **Simplified too** |
| `cuvs_yhwh_integrity_test` | six OCR corruptions, incl. 像烧碎一样, a simile missing its stubble (H7179 קַשׁ) |
| `bundled_font_coverage_test` | 衞 敍 綵 鋭 and three more are not in the bundled subset — tofu until `build_font_subsets.py` re-runs |
| `place_name_script_test` | the atlas's Traditional names, witnessed by the edition pair |

**What the tools already do**, and what the finished pass needs:

* publisher's WORDS, our 主 MARKERS re-applied — including the fix that
  footnotes about the word 主 must not be counted, which was skipping
  eleven verses including 申命記 6:4, the Shema;
* our named OCR repairs re-applied after adoption, so the verse takes the
  official wording and loses only the damage;
* punctuation takes the official form (「」→“”, the visible half of the
  ruling) while **Han glyphs keep ours**, because ours is a decision and
  theirs is a conversion;
* still to do: the same re-application for the typo-corruption set and
  the apparatus-quoting rules, and a font-subset rebuild.

**Measured, for whoever finishes it:** Simplified 355 verses behind
(Words) / 59 (Sword); Traditional ~14,900, nearly all of it the quotation
convention; **733 LJK footnotes** the official build carries and these
assets do not; and nine LJK verses — 馬太福音 21:44, 路加福音 23:34a and
哥林多後書 13:14 among them — where the two sides split the text
differently and adopting per-verse would DELETE scripture. Those nine
need a ruling, not a tool.

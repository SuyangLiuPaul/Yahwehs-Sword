/// 2026-08-09 (SeekSparks): the Atlas — the ONE map surface, opened from
/// Resources.
///
/// **Why this page exists rather than a second map.** `DELETION-REVIEW`
/// §4 found the app growing two of them: a lens over the workbench's
/// centre pane, and the #277 Places tab's "Show on map". The user's
/// decision on 2026-08-08 was one map surface, reached from Resources
/// the way the family tree is, with the gazetteer feeding it — the
/// verse-linked question ("what does this passage name?") stays in the
/// Analysis pane, but the MAP moves out of the reading column. That is
/// also bwh07's own filing: a map is a reference database you CONSULT,
/// not a tool that operates on the text in front of you.
///
/// **What it is, in one line.** The index at the back of a printed
/// atlas, wired to the plate: type a name, see where it is, and read the
/// list of every verse that names it.
///
/// **Where BibleWorks stops.** bwh33's Find Place window locates a site
/// by name and then offers exactly one route back to scripture: a
/// right-click that runs a *text search* for the word. That is weaker
/// than it sounds, in two ways this page fixes.
///
///   1. It cannot tell Syrian Antioch from Pisidian Antioch. They are
///      500 km apart and spelled identically, so the search returns both
///      cities' verses under one pin, at one set of coordinates. The
///      gazetteer keeps them as two entries with two locations, and this
///      page draws both.
///
///      It does NOT divide the verses between them, and this file used
///      to say it did. Measured: of the gazetteer's 80 ordinal groups,
///      66 carry byte-identical reference lists — `Antioch 1` and
///      `Antioch 2` have the same 18 — and all 14 of the rest overlap.
///      Not one is a clean partition. The ordinal separates the SITES;
///      the reference list is shared, and saying otherwise was a claim
///      read off the shape of the data rather than out of it. See
///      `docs/DATA-INTEGRITY.md` check 38.
///   2. It is English-only, because the maps database is indexed in
///      English. A reader in CUVS gets nothing. Here the index searches
///      English, Simplified and Traditional names at once whatever the
///      reading version is, and *prints* the name in the reading
///      version's script (#283).
///
/// The book scope (#280) is the third thing BibleWorks' map has no
/// equivalent of: scoped to Acts, the index stops being a gazetteer and
/// becomes the itinerary of Acts, ordered by how much of Acts happens
/// there.
///
/// Ranking, scoping, grouping and the label budget are all in
/// `utils/atlas_index.dart`, which is pure and under test. This file is
/// layout.

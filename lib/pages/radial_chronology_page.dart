///
/// World history on one wheel: 4200 BC at twelve o'clock, time sweeping
/// clockwise to the present, one concentric band per people or
/// institution, every dated thing drawn on the band it belongs to.
///
/// WHY BANDS AND NOT ONE STREAM OF DATES. The engraved chronologies
/// organise by NATION, not by kind-of-event: Israel is a band, Rome is
/// a band, the church is a band. That is what lets a reader follow one
/// people down the centuries instead of reading an undifferentiated
/// queue of years, and it is why such charts can carry a thousand
/// entries and still be read.
///
/// WHY THE EVENT TEXT RUNS OUTWARD. Angular space is scarce — every
/// degree of the rim is contested, and two events a decade apart fight
/// for the same arc. Radial space is nearly free: a label running
/// outward occupies an angle no wider than its type, so a crowded
/// century spreads along the radius instead of overprinting. Tangential
/// labels can only be resolved by dropping one, which loses the entry
/// and still looks crowded. Several events in one year stack outward
/// along the same spoke — see `stackRadialLabels`.
///
/// WHY THE COLOURS ARE THE LINES OF GENESIS 10. The bands are coloured
/// by descent from Shem, Ham and Japheth. That organising idea is the
/// table of nations itself, which this app reads out of its own
/// scripture asset and cites verse by verse — so a reader who wonders
/// why Egypt is one colour and Greece another can open the band and be
/// sent to Genesis 10:6 or 10:2. Two bands are not descents at all and
/// are coloured apart: the church, and the text of scripture.
///
/// WHAT IS HERE, AND ON WHAT AXIS. Two kinds of mark, and the
/// difference between them is the whole design.
///
/// A SPOKE SAYS WHEN. Every event is a moment: a tick on its own band
/// and text running outward. Adam, Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel,
/// Jared, Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech and Shelah have birth spokes like
/// anything else, because a birth is a moment.
///
/// AN ARC SAYS HOW LONG, AND ALONGSIDE WHOM. The lifespans of Genesis 5
/// and 11 — Adam to Moses, 25 men — are drawn in the label annulus,
/// eleven sub-rings deep, each life running from its birth year to its
/// death year. This is what a spoke cannot do and must not try to: an
/// arc shows Methuselah's years ending in the year of the flood, which
/// the text nowhere states and the arithmetic does, and it shows the
/// eleven lives that overlap between Noah and Abraham. No death events
/// were added for the same reason — fourteen more spokes in a sector
/// that already holds fifty would be redundancy, and the arc's end IS
/// the death.
///
/// THEY ARE ON ONE AXIS, NOT TWO. Anno Mundi figures reach BC years
/// through `bible_timeline.json`'s `_meta.creation.year` (4114 BC),
/// derived once by `tools/audit_dates.py` as Thiele's Solomon counted
/// back along twenty-five stated intervals, and every Abraham-to-Moses
/// arc lands exactly on the spoke this wheel already drew for him. If
/// that field cannot be read, the layer draws NOTHING — a fallback
/// constant here is how one man ends up with two years.
///
/// MASORETIC IS DRAWN; THE SEPTUAGINT IS PRINTED. The Greek chain puts
/// the creation 1,366 years earlier, and carrying it on the axis would
/// cost about a fifth of the angular resolution of every event on the
/// wheel for the sake of nineteen arcs. So the arcs are Masoretic, the
/// layer's own row says so, and every arc's sheet prints BOTH
/// traditions' figures with their verses — so no tradition is chosen in
/// silence.
///
/// HONESTY. Every event carries a `basis` — the text states it, or
/// Thiele's reconstruction supplies the year, or it is the date any
/// general reference gives — and the detail sheet says which. Every
/// entry carries `approximate` explicitly, so an absent flag never has
/// to be read as a claim. A power that has not ended carries no end
/// year and is drawn to the axis end, labelled "present": writing this
/// year in would read as though it had ended, and would go stale every
/// January.

/// 140 post-1900 events — 8.06x their share of the axis — finally have
/// room to print their own titles.
///
/// This is NOT the same fix the strip got, and the difference is the
/// whole reason both forms exist. `InteractiveViewer` scales both axes
/// together, so raising this ceiling magnifies Methuselah's 969 years
/// along with Zimri's seven days: the crowding gets pushed off the
/// screen rather than resolved. The strip's ladder separates the two
/// axes and actually resolves it. Raising this is worth doing because a

  // so there is no BC year to draw him at (the reason is set out under

  // the app never having heard of him.
  //
  // NO NUMBER IN THIS SENTENCE. Eight of these men are given different
  // lifespans by the Masoretic text and the Septuagint, and this page
  // has no way to let a reader choose between them. The Chronology
  // page does. Printing "969 years" here would pick one silently.
  //
  // No pronoun either — the same sentence has to serve whoever the
  // reader typed.
  // The heading over the reigns inside a kingdom's sheet. {n} is read
  // from `hebrew_kings.json`, never written here: twenty and twenty is
  // Thiele's count, not a fact about the world, and a number typed into
  // a heading is a number that goes stale silently.

  //
  // Deliberately NOT the wheel's `wheelEvents` heading ("Events · n"),
  // which the band's sheet uses. That one means "this band's events";
  // this one means "events that happened while this stood", which is a
  // weaker and different claim — the Fire of Rome is not an event OF

    // 588 labels round 320° is one every 0.54° — far past shoulder to

    // to read. (This comment used to say 189, the corpus size when it
    // was written; the figure below was derived from that one and is
    // wrong by the same neglect.) Drawing them all and letting them
    // touch is the one thing that must not happen.
    //
    // So: a label needs about 1.35 line-heights of angular room at the
    // radius it sits on. That room is measured ON SCREEN, so zooming in
    // buys real space and more labels appear.
    //
    // WHAT THIS COMMENT USED TO SAY, and why it mattered: "at 1x
    // roughly half the corpus is drawn, by 3x all of it. Nothing is
    // lost." Measured through this very arithmetic over the shipped 491
    // events on a 900 px canvas, it is 55 at 1x — 11%, not half — and
    // 136 at the `InteractiveViewer`'s maximum 14x, so about 72% of the
    // corpus can be seen at NO magnification this app permits. Zoom
    // cannot in principle rescue the worst of it: angle is linear in
    // the year, so the 125 events sharing a year with another event sit
    // at identical angles for ever. A false belief about the data
    // became a design that shipped a silent 89% cut with the figure 491
    // printed in the hub two inches away.
    //
    // Events that cannot each have a label are grouped. At overview
    // a filled tick indicates the cluster; zooming exposes its +n
    // badge. Tapping either opens all members, and the explorer lists
    // the individual events in readable rows at every magnification.

    // apart their streams were.
    //
    // Since the ticks moved onto their own streams' rings (2026-09-15)
    // it is wrong twice over:
    //
    //   * ACROSS STREAMS. A church event and an Israel event five years
    //     apart were merged into one spoke, so tapping opened a cluster
    //     mixing two streams — for marks that are no longer anywhere
    //     near each other, being a whole ring apart.
    //   * AT THE WRONG RADIUS. The gap was computed at the OUTER band
    //     radius for every ring. An inner ring has less arc per degree,
    //     so the same angle there is a shorter run of pixels, and its
    //     marks were being thinned as though they had the outermost
    //     ring's room.

    // Each ring is now thinned against its own radius, which is also

    // own crowding, not on the average of four rings.

  /// nations spelled him Salah while everything else spelled him
  /// Shelah — and is not any more: all five surfaces agree on the
  /// modern form and the KJV's is carried as `nameKjv`.
  ///
  /// THE LAST MAN IT ANSWERED FOR WAS NAHOR THE ELDER, and his case is
  /// closed too. The sentence used to read "not on this wheel: the text
  /// gives a lifespan, not a date" — true while no lifespan was drawn,
  /// false the moment one was — and was rewritten to report the real
  /// gap, which was a SPELLING: the chart called him Nahor, the family

  /// the longer name. The Israel band now DISPLAYS "Nahor (the elder)",

  /// — Genesis 11:22 and Genesis 11:26 — so the longer name is a real
  /// record and the reader gets the record instead of a sentence about
  /// one.
  ///
  /// KEPT ANYWAY, and deliberately. This is a guard on the DATA, not a
  /// special case for a man: the family tree can gain a record tomorrow
  /// whose name no wheel record displays, and the failure it prevents —
  /// "nothing matches" about someone the app charts — is one this page

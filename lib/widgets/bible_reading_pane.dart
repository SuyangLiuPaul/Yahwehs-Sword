/// 2026-08 (ported from YsWords v1.3.156): "护眼" (easy-on-eyes) reading
/// theme — a warm sepia/paper palette for the Bible reading pane, toggled
/// independently of the app-wide light/dark [ThemeMode] via
/// `AppSettings.readingPaperTheme`. Deliberately fixed/warm rather than
/// dark-mode-aware — Kindle/WeChat Read-style "paper" modes stay warm
/// regardless of system theme, since the whole point is a paper-like read,
/// not a tinted dark mode.
/// 2026-09-08: the seven constants that used to live here are gone, and
/// this is the note about why, because deleting a palette without one is
/// how it grows back.
///
/// They were a SECOND COPY of `WbColors.paper`, which exists — and says
/// in its own doc that it exists — to end exactly this duplication. Four
/// of the seven had drifted: the surface was two value-steps below the
/// page where the palette says one, the border was 1.36:1 against the
/// palette's 1.21:1 (the drawn line the 2026-09-07 modern pass removed
/// everywhere else), and the selection was a different tan.
///
/// The fifth was the one a reader would actually complain about. Being
/// `const`, the accent could not pass through `WbColors.tinted`, so in
/// 护眼 mode the classic reader answered every colour the reader chose
/// with the same fixed gold — the identical defect reported against the
/// tab bar on 2026-09-08 and fixed there by promoting `accent` to a
/// tinted role.
///
/// Every site now reads `WbColors.of(context)`. That is already the
/// paper palette wherever this pane is built: all three call sites are
/// in `workbench_page.dart`, inside `workbenchTheme(paper: paper,
/// accent: settings.primaryColor)` (`workbench_page.dart:1523`).

///
///  * `workbench_theme.dart` — *square corners and 1px hairline borders,

///    reader of the centre pane sees at all times.
///  * The blur never ran. Every call site passed `opaque: true`, which
///    took the branch that skips [BackdropFilter] entirely, so the
///    "glass" was a name for an opaque fill. That dead branch is gone
///    rather than kept as an option nothing selects.
///  * **Squaring the corners is what makes the correct border legal.**
///    A bar flush against an edge wants a hairline on the ONE side
///    facing the text — not a box drawn round all four, whose bottom
///    edge doubled up with the pane divider beneath it. The rounded
///    version could not do that: a non-uniform [Border] alongside a

///   - mixes in `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` so PageView keeps it
///     alive when scrolled off-screen (cached up to ~3-5 pages);
///   - if it's the active page (idx matches
///     `mp.currentBook|chapter`), registers its controllers with
///     `mp.setActiveChapterControllers` so external scroll commands
///     (pendingJump from search / library / sermon; jumpToTop on
///     chapter change; scroll-to-top button) reach the right SPL
///     through the existing `mp.itemScrollController` getter.
///
/// Result: a swipe to the next chapter no longer triggers a
/// preview→SPL widget-tree replacement. The neighbour page's SPL is
/// already mounted (kept alive); settling on it is a viewport
/// translation, not a rebuild. User-perceived stutter drops to zero.

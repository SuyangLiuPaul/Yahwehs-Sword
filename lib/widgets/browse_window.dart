/// 2026-08 (SeekSparks): the Browse window, rebuilt to match BibleWorks.
///
/// The first attempt showed ONE verse at a time, stacked across
/// versions, with a stepper to move. That is not what BibleWorks' Browse
/// window does and it made the pane feel like a flash card rather than a
/// text. The real thing shows the **whole chapter, continuously**, with
/// every selected version printed one after another for each verse:
///
///     NAS  Genesis 1:1  In the beginning God created the heavens…
///     KJV  Genesis 1:1  In the beginning God created the heaven…
///     WTT  Genesis 1:1  בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים …
///     NAS  Genesis 1:2  And the earth was a formless and desolate…
///
/// You scroll it like a text, and the version tag colour is what lets
/// you read one translation straight down without the others getting in
/// the way. This file replaces `parallel_verse_view.dart`.
///
/// Hovering an original-language word reports it upward without a click
/// — BibleWorks' defining interaction, and the reason its Analysis
/// window feels alive.

/// The one word gap in the Browse pane.
///
/// Two of the three render paths are `Wrap`s of individual words, and
/// until 2026-08-17 they disagreed: the originals set `spacing: 5`, the
/// tagged translation set nothing at all. The gap is named once here,
/// and it stays applied to the originals ONLY — which looks like the
/// inconsistency this pass was cleaning up, so here is the measurement
/// that says it is not.
///
/// An originals token is bare: **0 of 438,821** words in
/// `assets/originals/` carry any whitespace of their own, so without a
/// gap the Hebrew and the Greek would run together. Every tagged
/// edition, by contrast, already carries its own spacing IN THE DATA —
/// but by three different conventions, which is why the tempting
/// one-line summary ("tagged runs end in a space") is false. Share of
/// runs carrying a leading or trailing space, whole corpus:
///
///   `bsb`       91.57%  — TRAILING          (`"Adam, "`)
///   `kjvs`      68.53%  — LEADING           (`", Sheth"`)
///   `lxxwh`     94.28%  — mixed, both
///   `cuvs-plus`  0.00%  — Chinese does not put spaces between words
///   `cuvs-yhwh`  0.05%    at all, so a gap would open a hole in the
///                         middle of 亚当生塞特
///
/// So the rule is "add a gap where the text has none of its own", and
/// the tagged path is the one that must NOT get it: the same 5px would
/// double-space the BSB, mis-space the KJV, and break Chinese outright.
/// Do not "harmonise" these two numbers by making them equal.
const double kBrowseWordGap = 5.0;

/// Wrapped lines take their rhythm from `WbType.lineHeight` alone.
///
/// The originals `Wrap` used to add 1px of `runSpacing` on top of it,

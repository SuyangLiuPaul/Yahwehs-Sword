/// 2026-09-14, adopted from the 雅偉的話 app on the owner's instruction:
/// 「yahwehdehua app apk的 close和expand连在一起的其实设计得非常合理 …
/// 要用adopt yahwehdehua这个设计 … apply在这两个app三个界面上」.
///
/// WHAT IT REPLACES, AND WHY EACH PART OF IT IS THE WAY IT IS. This app
/// used to draw a book icon at each note's position and open that one
/// note as a boxed card in the middle of the sentence. Three complaints,
/// and the new shape answers each one:
///
///   * 「根本看不清」 — the notes had no structure. 梁家鏗's 羅馬書 8:26
///     carries several, and run together they are a wall with nothing to
///     say where one ends. **Numbered, one per line**: the numbers are
///     the only structure the notes come with, so they are the structure
///     used. A superscript in the verse points at the line below.
///   * 「para mode不好按」 — the tap target was a glyph a few pixels
///     wide, mid-prose. **There is nothing to tap to read a note now**:
///     the notes are already on screen, and the only control is the
///     underlined label, which is words wide.
///   * 「words你就截开几段用起来很难受」 — opening a note in place split
///     the verse into pieces. **The block sits after the verse**, so the
///     scripture is never cut.
///
/// 2026-09-14, second pass, from the 雅偉的話 WEB reader rather than its
/// app — 「这种可以打开在words sword reader parallel mode 三个页面apply
/// 就很好」, with the control circled. The first pass truncated the notes
/// at 160 characters and put an underlined link at the seam; this one is
/// what that site actually does, and it is better in two ways:
///
///   * The control is a **pill** — 「譯者註 ▾」 — outlined when shut and
///     filled when open. It is a button-shaped thing with a border, not
///     a run of underlined words, so on a phone it reads as pressable
///     before you press it.
///   * Opening shows **all** of the notes. A half-note ending in `…` is
///     not something anyone wanted to read; the reader either wants the
///     apparatus or does not.
///
/// Its CSS (`.fnote-fold > summary`, `css/bible.css`) is a `<details>`
/// with `border-radius: 999px` and a `::after` of ▾ / ▴, and that is
/// what this reproduces.
///
/// A SHORT block is not folded at all, which is that site's rule too:
/// it wraps only the notes that are longer than the verse they hang off.
/// Putting 參4.6、16 behind a button would make the reader work for six
/// characters.

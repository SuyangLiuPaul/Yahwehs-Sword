/// The wall itself: one verse, very large, with the reference in a
/// corner and nothing else.
///
/// Split out of `projection_page.dart` because the page is the operator
/// — cursor, keys, controls, the second edition's corpus — and this is
/// the congregation. The two have different audiences and almost no
/// shared state, and keeping them apart is what lets a test assert what
/// the room can see without driving a keyboard.
///
/// ## THE CHOSEN SIZE IS A CEILING
///
/// [typeSize] is what the operator asked for, and the passage is drawn
/// at that size whenever it fits. When it does not, `BoxFit.scaleDown`
/// shrinks the whole block rather than letting it run off the wall or
/// clip — a clipped verse is not an ugly verse, it is a different verse,
/// and the congregation has no way to know which. The fit's child is
/// pinned to the full usable WIDTH, so the horizontal scale factor is
/// always exactly 1 and the only thing `scaleDown` can respond to is a
/// block too tall for the room. Without that pin a `FittedBox` gives its
/// child unbounded width and the verse lays out as a single line.
///
/// ## WHY THE SECOND EDITION IS STACKED, NOT COLUMNED
///
/// The Browse window puts editions side by side because a desk is wider
/// than it is tall and the reader is comparing words. A projector is
/// 16:9 and the congregation is reading sentences, so two half-width
/// columns would halve the line length and roughly double the number of
/// lines — the same words, in a narrower measure, smaller. Stacked, both
/// editions keep the full width.
///
/// The second block is set slightly smaller ([kProjectionSecondScale]).
/// Not because it matters less, but because something has to lead: two
/// blocks of identical type with a gap between them read as one
/// paragraph that has been interrupted, and the room needs to know at a
/// glance which one is the sermon's text.
///
/// ## THE GROUND IS CHOSEN, AND BLANKING GOES TO THE SAME GROUND
///
/// 2026-09-09. This used to paint one fixed colour, `WbColors.dark`'s
/// `groundBg`, and the blank state painted the same one — which is why
/// the blank key was honest. The operator can now choose
/// ([ProjectionGround]), and the honesty is now a property that has to
/// be maintained rather than one that falls out of there being no
/// choice: [blank] paints the SAME [ProjectionGroundPaint] the lit
/// state does, whatever the choice is. Blanking is a shutter over the
/// text, not a different screen.
///
/// Every ground is dark, and `projection_setup.dart`'s library doc
/// argues why at length: a projector adds light, so a light ground
/// washes the room and makes the blank key a flash. That file is also
/// where the two numbers live that stop this from being a matter of
/// taste — a luminance ceiling on any colour a ground paints, and a
/// contrast floor for scripture against it, both asserted in
/// `projection_setup_test.dart`.
///
/// One ground is a gradient rather than a flat fill, and it is drawn
/// with a `DecoratedBox` where the flat ones stay a `ColoredBox`. Not an
/// implementation detail: a one-colour `LinearGradient` would paint
/// identically and would make the default ground stop being the plain
/// fill of the app's own `groundBg` that it has always been.
///
/// ## EVERY STYLE HERE PINS `kCjkFontFallback`, INCLUDING THE REFERENCE
///
/// The app theme already carries the bundled CJK subset in its own
/// `fontFamilyFallback`, so inheriting would work today. Scripture
/// surfaces in this app pin it anyway — `main.dart`'s own comment says
/// "verse text + word spans already use kCjkFontFallback" — and this is
/// the surface where the failure is worst. On CanvasKit an unresolved
/// face draws as tofu, and 34 tofu boxes at 64 px on a wall in front of
/// a congregation is not a degraded reading, it is no reading at all.
/// One inherited property away from that is too close.

/// 2026-09-08 (SeekSparks): the synonym and script data a fuzzy search
/// expands a query with — every byte of it derived from, or evidenced
/// by, something this repository already ships.
///
/// ## Why this file exists at all, and what is NOT in it
///
/// 微读圣经's Chinese fuzzy search is driven by four shipped dictionary
/// files (`hmm_model.dict`, `stop_words.dict`, `synonyms_sc.dict`,
/// `synonyms_tc.dict`). **None of them is here and none of them was
/// read.** They are another product's data, under no licence that
/// permits redistribution, and a search feature that cannot be shipped
/// is not a feature. The same ruling closed two other doors:
///
///   * **OpenCC's conversion dictionaries** (Apache-2.0, and used
///     OFFLINE by this project already — `lib/models/strongs.dart`
///     records that the Strong's Traditional glosses were produced with
///     `opencc -c s2t.json`). Vendoring them at runtime would mean
///     carrying a third party's 30k-entry table and its licence file for
///     a job this repo's own assets already answer. See below.
///   * **A Chinese word-frequency list** from any of the usual corpora.
///     Every one either has no licence statement or has a research-only
///     one, and provenance we cannot name is provenance we do not ship.
///
/// ## Provenance of each table below
///
/// **[kCuvSimplifiedChars] / [kCuvTraditionalChars]** — derived from
/// `assets/cuvs-yhwh.json` and `assets/cuvs-yhwh-tr.json`, the
/// Simplified and Traditional 和合本 (Chinese Union Version, 1919,
/// public domain) this app already ships. The two files hold the same
/// 31,102 verses under the same ids, and — measured — every verse pair
/// is character-for-character the same LENGTH, with zero exceptions.
/// That alignment is what makes the correspondence derivable rather
/// than guessed: 1,107 Han character pairs differ, and
/// `test/search_synonyms_test.dart` re-derives all of them from the two
/// assets on every run and fails if these two strings drift from what
/// the shipped text actually says.
///
/// Licence: the source is public-domain scripture already in this
/// repository, and a table of which character stands opposite which is
/// a fact about that text.
///
/// **[kCuvCommonHanChars]** — the same derivation, one step simpler:
/// the Han characters occurring in more than a fifth of the 和合本's
/// verses. This is the licence-clean replacement for a stop-word list.
/// It is deliberately a list of CHARACTERS and not of words, because
/// that is what can be derived without a segmentation dictionary — the
/// thing this file exists to avoid needing.
///
/// **[kSearchSynonymGroups]** — hand-authored for this repository, and
/// every group carries the in-repo evidence that licenses it, in its
/// own `evidence` field. Two of the four are the scripture text saying
/// so itself (「矶法翻出来就是彼得」), one is the existing alias table in
/// `strongs_service.dart`, and one is a measured hole in the shipped
/// editions. Nothing was transcribed from a dictionary.
///
/// ## The alias table this DUPLICATES, and why
///
/// `lib/services/strongs_service.dart` (search for `_aliasToStrongs`)
/// already pins 雅伟 / 雅偉 / 雅威 / 耶和华 / 耶和華 / Yahweh / YHWH /
/// Jehovah to H3068, and 耶稣 / 耶穌 / Jesus / Iesous to G2424. That is
/// a synonym layer, it predates this one, and the divine-name group
/// below is the same set of spellings. **It should be ONE table** —
/// `_aliasToStrongs` reading its Chinese and English forms from
/// [kSearchSynonymGroups] and keeping only the Strong's number it adds.
/// It is not one table today because `strongs_service.dart` is under
/// another agent's hand this week and a two-file edit would collide.
/// The duplication is therefore deliberate, recorded, and one import
/// wide. A test asserts the two agree on the divine name, so they
/// cannot silently diverge while they are apart.
library;

/// One set of spellings a fuzzy search treats as the same word.
class SearchSynonymGroup {
  const SearchSynonymGroup({required this.forms, required this.evidence});

  /// Every accepted spelling, lower-cased where the script has case.
  /// A query matching any one of them may be rewritten to any other.
  final List<String> forms;

  /// Where the claim comes from — a verse of a shipped edition, a
  /// measurement over one, or another table in this repository. Not
  /// decoration: this string is the reason the group is allowed to
  /// exist, and a group that cannot state one does not go in.
  final String evidence;
}

/// Simplified Han characters that differ from their Traditional
/// counterpart in the shipped 和合本, positionally paired with
/// [kCuvTraditionalChars].
///
/// 1,115 pairs. Ten Simplified characters stand opposite two different
/// Traditional ones (众 → 眾/衆, 么 → 麽/麼, 干 → 乾/幹, 鉴 → 鑒/鑑,
/// 签 → 簽/籤, 尝 → 嘗/嚐, 发 → 發/髮, 仑 → 侖/崙, 墙 → 牆/墻,
/// 须 → 須/鬚), so they appear twice here; the more frequent Traditional
/// form is listed FIRST, which is what makes `simplifiedToTraditional`
/// deterministic. In the other direction there is no ambiguity at all —
/// measured, not assumed: no Traditional character in these 31,102
/// verses stands opposite two different Simplified ones.
///
/// It was 1,107 pairs and six such characters until 2026-09-08. The

/// collapses were repaired: before that, 发 was 發 everywhere including
/// 白髮, and 松/胡/谷/采 stood opposite themselves in every verse, so
/// the correspondence could not see the second form at all.
///
/// **Do not hand-edit the two literals below.** They are derived from
/// the assets; regenerate with `tools/build_cuv_char_table.py`, which
/// uses the same derivation `test/search_synonyms_test.dart` checks
/// them against.

  //
  // ⚠️ AN OPEN QUESTION FOR THE OWNER, recorded rather than decided.
  // `bsb-yhwh` is the same translation as `bsb`, and the reader-visible
  // difference is smaller than it looks. `bsb` stores "the LORD" in
  // 13,172 verses, but `text_patterns.dart::_normalizeDivineNames`
  // already rewrites all-caps LORD to Yahweh on the way to the screen,
  // so the two render identically in most of them. Measured
  // reference-by-reference over the 31,086 they share, AFTER that
  // normalisation, 636 verses still differ — 2.0%:
  //
  //   * 326 in the OT. 299 of them are "Lord GOD" — Adonai plus YHWH,
  //     which the BSB sets in small caps and this edition reads "Lord
  //     Yahweh" (Gen 15:2, 2 Sam 7:18-22, 1 Kgs 8:53). The app's
  //     normaliser rewrites `LORD` and cannot touch `GOD`. The other 27
  //     are the short form יָהּ, printed "Yah" here and "the LORD" in the
  //     BSB — "His name is Yah" (Ps 68:4), "the throne of Yah" (Ex
  //     17:16), and Exodus 15:2, which opens the Song of the Sea.
  //   * 310 in the NT, where κύριος is either restored as
  //     `Lord [Yahweh]` (188 verses — Matt 1:20, 1 Cor 1:31) or flagged
  //     with an asterisk (113 verses, 1 Cor 2:8). Nothing else in this
  //     catalog makes a claim about the divine name in the New
  //     Testament at all, and `[Yahweh]` is not a new convention for it:
  //     `bracketSpanKind` already types that exact token as
  //     `ScriptureSpanKind.divineName` for 和合本雅伟版's `主[雅伟]`.
  //   * plus 237 translator's footnotes across 224 verses ("not in the
  //     Hebrew") that the plain BSB does not carry at all.
  //
  // That is a real editorial claim and it is the ministry's own, which
  // is why the row ships. But on 2026-09-08 — the same day — the owner
  // hid `cuvs-plus` with 「有雅+ 就不用和合本+了」, and the relation there
  // is exactly this one: one base text, one row restoring the divine
  // name. Applied here that would mean hiding `bsb`, not this. It was
  // NOT done, because `bsb` is the English locale default
  // (`localeDefaultVersion`), is the only English row in
  // `unrestrictedCopyVersions` with tagging, and taking the English
  // default off the interface is the owner's call and not an
  // importer's. If he wants the same rule applied, it is two lines:
  // `bsb` into [disabledVersions] and a `'bsb': 'bsb-yhwh'` row in
  // [retiredVersionSuccessors].
  //
  // **He did.** 2026-09-08, later the same day, having been shown the
  // 636-verse figure: 「bsbs 不用，就 bsb yahweh 版本导入」 in Words, and
  // then the same for here. Both lines are written, plus the one the
  // note above named as a consequence rather than as work: the English
  // `localeDefaultVersion` moved to `bsb-yhwh`, and the first-run Browse
  // stacks in `workbench_warmup.dart` moved with it in all three
  // locales.
  //
  // The `unrestrictedCopyVersions` entry did NOT move, which the note
  // above got wrong. That set records a LICENCE, not a visibility:
  // `bsb` stays in it (public domain, hidden or not — `cuvs-plus` sits
  // there on the same footing) and `bsb-yhwh` stays out of it, because
  // its divine-name reading is 雅伟的话's own editorial work and travels
  // on the clipboard. `test/yahwehdehua_editions_test.dart` had already
  // pinned that, and it is right. The consequence is real and is the
  // owner's to revisit if he dislikes it: the English default is now a
  // 500-verse-capped copy edition, exactly as the Chinese default
  // `cuvs-yhwh` already was.
  //
  // `test/no_duplicate_version_text_test.dart` was consulted before
  // either row was written, not after: it scores this pair at 83.7%
  // agreement, under its 90% gate, because it reads the ASSETS and the
  // assets really do differ in 13,172 verses. Passing that gate is not
  // the same as earning the row, which is what the paragraphs above are

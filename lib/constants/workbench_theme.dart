/// 2026-08 (SeekSparks): the Workbench's own dense desktop theme.
///
/// The rest of SeekSparks is a touch-first reading app — rounded cards,
/// generous padding, a purple Material 3 palette. That is right for a
/// phone and wrong for this workspace: BibleWorks is a *dense, flat,
/// neutral, keyboard-driven desktop tool*, and putting its three windows
/// inside Material 3 chrome produced something that read as "a mobile
/// app in three columns" rather than as BibleWorks.
///
/// So the Workbench gets its own [ThemeData], applied to that subtree
/// only. Nothing here leaks into the phone reader.
///
/// The rules this encodes, taken from BibleWorks 10:
///   * ~12px body text on a ~1.3 line height — roughly half the vertical
///     space per line that the reading app uses.
///   * 1px hairline borders. No shadows, no cards, no elevation.
///   * A neutral ground. The ONLY saturated colour in the whole window
///     is the per-version tag and the blue of a clickable reference —
///     which is exactly why those read as information rather than
///     decoration.
///   * Chrome (menu bar, pane titles, status bar) one step smaller
///     again, at 11px.
///
/// **2026-09-07 — the square-corner rule is retired, at the owner's
/// request.** The brief was "现在的好像小时候软件窗口界面 但是我要最现代的
/// 界面风格": the workspace read as 1990s desktop software and should
/// read as current desktop software instead. Two things were doing
/// that, and neither of them was density:
///
///   1. **A grey chrome bar.** [WbColors.chromeBg] was #E9EBEF against
///      a #FFFFFF pane — a full value step, which is exactly how Win32
///      and Motif drew a toolbar, and how nothing drawn after about
///      2015 does. Linear, Raycast, Vercel and Arc all put chrome on
///      the SAME ground as content and separate it with a hairline.
///      Chrome is now within a couple of percent of the pane; the
///      border does the separating.
///   2. **A drawn rule instead of a hairline.** [WbColors.border] was
///      #BCC2CC — 2.2:1 against white, which the eye reads as a LINE,
///      not as an edge. The modern equivalent is ~8% black. Sixty-seven
///      borders at 2.2:1 is a wireframe; the same sixty-seven at 8% is
///      structure you stop noticing.
///
/// Corner radius is the third, and it is the one the old rule forbade
/// outright. It comes back the way font size came back in #315 — as a
/// SCALE on [WbMetrics] ([WbMetrics.radiusControl] /
/// [WbMetrics.radiusSurface] / [WbMetrics.radiusPill]) rather than as
/// thirty independently chosen numbers. `test/page_chrome_pass_test.dart`
/// was the ratchet that held the old rule; it now enforces the new one
/// — a `Radius.circular` in a converted file must read its number off
/// [WbMetrics], and shadows and elevation stay banned, because "no
/// cards" was the half of #279 that was always right. A rounded corner
/// is a 2015 convention; a drop shadow under a flat pane is still a
/// Material 3 tell.
///
/// What did NOT change is density. 12px body text on a 1.32 line height
/// is the reason this tool can show four translations of a verse at
/// once, and modern does not mean airy.

  /// one. Linear does exactly this with #5e6ad2 — links, selection,
  /// focus, and nothing else.
  ///
  ///   * [link] — every clickable reference. THE place the accent goes.
  ///   * [accent] — the active state: a selected tab, a live toggle, a
  ///     focused row.
  ///   * [selectionBg] — the current verse. Reads as "the accent, very
  ///     dilute", which is what a selection should be.

/// 2026-08-06: the Workbench's type scale, RESOLVED FROM SETTINGS.
///
/// [WbMetrics] is a const class, so every size in the workbench was a
/// compile-time literal and the Settings sliders drove nothing here. An
/// audit found the workbench honoured 2 of 10 user settings: Font Size
/// (only after a fix earlier today) and Strong's visibility. Font
/// family, Menu Size, Line Spacing, the paper theme, paragraph mode —
/// all ignored, across 82 hardcoded call sites.
///
/// This is the missing piece: one resolved scale, read from context, so
/// a setting reaches the workbench the same way it reaches the reader.
///
/// The workbench stays DENSER than the reader on purpose — it is a
/// three-pane analysis surface, not a reading page. So settings scale
/// it RELATIVE to their own defaults rather than being adopted
/// outright: a reader at font size 24 gets a proportionally larger
/// workbench, not a workbench with 24px body text.
/// How much larger a [PhoneBoostedPage] draws on a phone.
///
/// 2026-09-21, 「跟words一样大」 for every page. Most of Sword reached
/// Words' sizes through the theme (`withPhoneTextRoles`), and the pages
/// ported from Words name Words' own numbers. What was left are the pages
/// Sword wrote for the workbench — Nave's, the lexicon, the
/// illustrations, the atlas, the concordance, the word list — which
/// name the workbench's dense 11 and 12 px and have no Words counterpart
/// to copy. (Phrasing is not one of them: it sizes itself off the
/// reader's own Font Size, so it was never small. Nor are the CHARTS —
/// the kings chart, the chronologies, the wheel: their label room is laid
/// out for the dense sizes, and boosting the kings chart was tried and
/// clipped 「大卫 公元前1010–」 to 「大卫 公元前」 at 390 wide.)
///
/// So they are calibrated to the band Words' own named sizes sit in.
/// Words' family tree, evidence and timeline set most of their text
/// between 13 and 16 px (measured glyph for glyph against Sword's ports
/// of the same pages, which match them); 1.25 takes the workbench's 11

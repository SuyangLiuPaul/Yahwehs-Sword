/// chronology wheel claims that path while it is open, so it is what a

/// is not a registered route, because the app declares no `routes` map
/// at all. Answering it HERE, rather than only in [appUnknownRoute], is
/// what makes a page path a page through both of its doors:
///
///   • COLD OPEN. On the web the engine's boot route name IS the hash
///     path, so `Navigator.defaultGenerateInitialRoutes` asks this
///     function for `/wheel` (with `allowNull: true`) while it builds
///     the very first frame. Unanswered, the route was dropped and the
///     initial stack was just `[home]` — so the reader watched the
///     splash, then the workbench's first frame, and only in THAT
///     frame's post-frame callback was the wheel pushed, with a page
///     transition, and only then did the wheel's `initState` start
///     loading `wheel_history.json`. Measured on dev v1.6.203:
///     `main.dart.js` landed at 179 ms and the wheel's own asset was
///     not requested until 30.6 s — the asset was never the cost, the
///     ordering was. Answered, the initial stack is `[home, wheel]`,
///     ADDED rather than pushed (so no transition); home is built
///     beneath but neither laid out nor painted, because the Overlay
///     marks entries below the last opaque one offstage; and the
///     wheel's asset request starts at the first frame instead of
///     after the workbench's.
///
///   • A LIVE TAB. Editing the fragment in the address bar, or pressing
///     Back / Forward onto a `#/wheel` entry, is a same-document
///     navigation: the engine does not restart the app, it hands the
///     framework `pushRoute('/wheel')` — and `pushNamed` consults this
///     function BEFORE `onUnknownRoute`. So both doors are now one
///     lookup, which is what `page_links.dart` promised.
///
/// Null for every other name, so `home:` still answers `/` and

///
/// 2026-09-03: this used to wrap the page in `SmallScreenGate`, because

///
///     [ROUTE] onGenerateRoute name=/genesis/1:1?v=nasb  (null)
///     [ROUTE] onUnknownRoute  name=/genesis/1:1?v=nasb
///     [MOUNT] _RootRouter #2
///
/// — two Search panes and two menu bars on screen; a second press gave
/// `#3`. Nothing about it was wheel-specific.
///
/// The mechanism is the web engine's SINGLE-ENTRY history mode, which
/// the non-Router Navigator selects for itself. The engine keeps one
/// entry of its own, the "flutter" entry, and treats everything above it
/// as pushed by somebody else. Every reader move IS somebody else:
/// `UrlSyncService` writes `#/<book>/<chapter>` with `history.pushState`
/// under its own `{'seeksparks': true}` tag, deliberately neither of the
/// engine's tags (see `history_state_repair.dart` for why that tag is
/// what it is). So on Back, `SingleEntryBrowserHistory.onPopState` takes
/// its `else` branch: capture the landed path, `go(-1)`, and again for
/// every app entry until it reaches the flutter entry — then hand the
/// framework `pushRoute(<the captured path>)`.
///
/// `WidgetsApp.didPushRouteInformation` answers that with
/// `navigator.pushNamed(path)`. A passage names no route, so it fell
/// through to [appUnknownRoute], whose answer for a stray name is the
/// app root — and THAT is the second workbench. The URL was right and
/// the reader had already been moved to it (the URL-sync layer's own
/// popstate listener applied every hash it walked past); the app pushed
/// a fresh copy of itself over the top anyway.
///
/// Two properties of the captured path are worth knowing before the
/// rules below, because both are counter-intuitive:
///
///   • It is the OLDEST app entry, not the one the reader just left.
///     `onPopState` overwrites its `_currentRouteName` on EVERY entry it
///     walks, so the surviving value is the one nearest the flutter
///     entry. Measured: a reader on `/genesis/1:16` pressed Back and the
///     path reported was `/genesis/1:1`.
///   • In a document cold-opened at `#/wheel`, that oldest entry IS
///     `#/wheel` — the wheel claims the URL on open and the claim is the
///     first thing written. So Back off a chapter reports the wheel, and
///     that is not a bug in the report.
///
/// What Back SHOULD do, which this is the statement of:
///
///   • Back off a page returns to what was underneath. The wheel is a
///     page; it closes, and the reader is there.
///   • Back within reader history moves the reader and mounts NOTHING.
///     The move has already happened on the way past. (It lands on the
///     oldest entry rather than the previous one, because the engine
///     rewound the whole run of app entries in one press. That is
///     single-entry mode; this seam cannot undo it, and pretending
///     otherwise would need the Router API and a real page stack.)
///   • Back at the first entry does whatever the browser would do. It
///     never arrives here: landing on the engine's ORIGIN entry takes
///     `onPopState`'s first branch, which sends `popRoute`, which
///     `WidgetsApp.didPopRoute` answers with `maybePop`. Untouched.
///   • Back onto a page entry OPENS that page — unless that page is
///     already what is on screen, in which case there is nothing to
///     restore and it is a plain Back off it. Without that last clause
///     the wheel opens a second wheel: opening one claims the URL and so
///     writes another `#/wheel` entry, and the next Back reports it.
///
/// The first three collapse into one action — pop one level — which is

    // workbench you cannot show is a menu bar over one column, which
    // is YsWords with extra steps. SmallScreenGate says so instead, and
    // as of 2026-08-08 it wraps `home:` rather than this line, so a
    // viewport that cannot carry the workbench never reaches the splash.

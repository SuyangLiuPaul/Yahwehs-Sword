// and 雅繁+ are not) and a tedious thing to re-say every time a verse is

// session; the follow-the-reader default is what nobody picked.
//
// NOT allowlisted here, unlike `_kChronologyView` above: the legal set
// is `interlinearEditions`, which is computed from the catalog and the
// tagged-asset set and so cannot be written as a const. The clamp is
// applied where it is read — an unoffered code resolves to the default
// rather than being honoured — which also means an edition that leaves
// `availableVersions` after a reader picked it degrades quietly to the
// default instead of blanking the panel.
//

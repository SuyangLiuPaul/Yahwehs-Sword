/// 2026-08-06 (SeekSparks): mark the search hits in the text itself.
///
/// SeekSparks could already list the verses a search matched, but the
/// text pane gave no clue WHICH word matched. In BibleWorks the hits are
/// highlighted where they occur, and that is what closes the loop: you
/// search, you glance at the verse, and you see the word without reading
/// the line looking for it. Without it a hit list is a table of
/// contents, not a result.
///
/// Three query shapes, three ways of matching:
///
///   * Strong's (`G25`, `G25 AND G26`, `G25*`) matches the NUMBER on a
///     tagged run. Exact, no guessing — the tagging already says which
///     word carries it.
///   * The command-line grammar (`.love god`, `'in the beginning`) marks
///     each term's literal core. The alternative — treating the raw text
///     as a substring — would mark nothing at all, because `.love` does
///     not occur in any verse. A silently unmarked hit list is exactly
///     the regression this file exists to prevent.
///   * Plain text matches substrings, case-insensitively.
///
/// A NOT term is deliberately not highlighted, in either grammar: `G25
/// NOT G26` and `.faith !works` both return verses that LACK the second
/// term, so there is nothing there to mark. Highlighting it would point
/// at the reason a verse was filtered OUT, in a list of verses that were
/// kept in.
///
/// A wildcard term is marked by its longest plain run, so `.faith*`
/// marks the "faith" inside "faithfulness" and not the whole word. That
/// under-marks rather than over-marks, which is the safe direction: the
/// reader's eye still lands on the right word.
///
/// Pure matching. The widget decides what a highlight looks like.

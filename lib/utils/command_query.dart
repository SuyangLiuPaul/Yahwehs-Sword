/// 2026-08-07 (SeekSparks): the BibleWorks command-line query language —
/// help topic bwh16, "The Command Line - Introduction".
///
/// The command line is the thing BibleWorks users describe when they say
/// BibleWorks was fast. It is one text box that does everything, and what
/// makes it a language rather than a search field is a single design
/// decision: **the first character says what kind of search this is.**
///
///     . word1 word2     both words, same verse            (AND)
///     / word1 word2     either word                       (OR)
///     ' word1 word2     word1 immediately followed by word2 (PHRASE)
///     ; word1 word2     the same, scanned verse by verse, so it may
///                       cross verse boundaries            (LINEAR PHRASE)
///
/// Until now SeekSparks' command line understood a reference, a version
/// abbreviation, a Strong's expression and a plain substring — and
/// nothing else. Typing `.love god`, which is the first thing anyone
/// with BibleWorks muscle memory types, searched for the literal string
/// ".love god" and found nothing. Worse, `love god` (no operator) went to
/// the space-stripped substring scan, so in English it quietly meant
/// "the phrase love god" and returned almost nothing, while in Chinese it
/// meant the right thing. One box, two silently different languages.
///
/// ## What a naive reading of "search operators" would miss
///
/// * `!` means two different things and both are needed. In an AND/OR
///   search `!barnabas` EXCLUDES the verse. In a phrase it matches a
///   position — "any word except this one" — which is how you find
///   anarthrous nouns in Greek: `'!the god`. Same character, one
///   filters verses, the other fills a slot.
/// * `*` means two different things too. Inside a word it is the
///   zero-or-more wildcard (`faith*`). Standing alone inside a phrase it
///   is a GAP: `'faith * christ` finds "faith in Christ" and "faith of
///   Christ", and `*3` widens that to three or fewer intervening words.
/// * `;N` appended to a search is a VERSE context, not a word count:
///   `.paul silas;10` finds Paul and Silas within ten verses of each
///   other. It is the operator that turns a verse search into a passage
///   search, and it is the one people forget exists.
///
/// ## Where BibleWorks has no answer and we need one: Chinese
///
/// BibleWorks' Far East command-line topic (bwh17b) is four pages about
/// IMEs, code pages and keyboard layouts. It says nothing whatsoever
/// about what a search MEANS in a language with no spaces — its whole
/// engine is built on whitespace-delimited words. SeekSparks' first
/// audience reads 和合本.
///
/// The resolution here is to keep one rule and let the script decide what
/// a token is, exactly as `phrase_match.dart` already does: **one token
/// per Han character, one token per alphabetic run.** Then
///
///     .爱 神        two terms, each one token → both characters present
///     .爱神         ONE term, two tokens in sequence → the substring 爱神
///     '神说要有光    one term, five tokens → an exact character run
///
/// falls out without a single Chinese-specific branch. A Chinese term is
/// a substring search and an English term is a word search, which is what
/// a reader of each language expects, and the difference is a property of
/// the script rather than a mode anyone has to select.
///
/// ## Deliberately not implemented (and why)
///
/// Detected and reported by name rather than silently mis-parsed:
///
/// * `=` fuzzy link stemming. See below — this entry stands, and the
///   reason it stands is not the one it used to give.
///
/// ## Formerly on that list: `~` regular expressions
///
/// 2026-09-08. Shipped in `regex_program.dart` and parsed by
/// [_parseRegex]. The old entry gave three reasons and every one of them
/// turned out to be a constraint rather than a veto:
///
/// * *"a user-supplied regex over 31k verses is a denial-of-service
///   waiting to happen without a timeout budget"* — true, and Dart has
///   no timeout to offer: `RegExp` backtracks, cannot be cancelled, and
///   on the web build takes the browser tab with it. But bwh43i prints
///   BibleWorks' whole operator table and it contains no backreference,
///   so the language is REGULAR and a Thompson NFA simulation matches it
///   in time linear in the text. The bound is structural rather than
///   supervised: there is no pathological pattern to time out, and
///   `regex_program.dart`'s test drives `(a+)+$` — the textbook
///   catastrophic backtracker — against 4,000 characters to say so. What
///   remains is total corpus work, which [kRegexStepBudget] bounds
///   before the scan starts rather than during it.
/// * *"it is English-only there"* — theirs, not ours. BibleWorks'
///   engine indexes whitespace-delimited words; this one matches the
///   verse string, so the script has no say in it. `~神.说` and
///   `~[神主]的` mean exactly what they look like, and a character class
///   or an alternation over Han is something the token grammar above
///   cannot express at all: `_compileTerm` splits a Han term one
///   character per position before it ever sees a `[`.
/// * *"case-sensitive"* — kept, and it is the reason this one search
///   runs against `MainProvider.wordKeys` instead of `searchKeys`.
///   `searchKeys` is the one corpus in this app that is lower-cased;
///   matching there would have made `~god` and `~God` the same search
///   while bwh16 offers `~god` specifically as the way to tell them
///   apart. See [_runRegex] for what that costs — the vowel-point
///   folding switch does not reach a `~` search, and `~LORD` finds
///   nothing because the corpus spells it `Yahweh`.
///
/// A regex hit is highlighted by its REQUIRED LITERAL — the longest run
/// of fixed characters every match must contain — carried on one
/// synthetic [QueryTerm] so that `search_highlight.dart` marks
/// `~And God said` without knowing this kind exists. `~(cat|dog)s` marks
/// only the `s`, and `~[a-z]+` marks nothing, which under-marks in the
/// same direction `.faith*` already does. It is not the matched span:
/// a span is per-verse and `highlightsForQuery` is a function of the
/// query alone.
///
/// ## Why `=` stays on that list, for a different reason than it gave
///
/// 2026-09-08, re-examined after `porter_stemmer.dart` landed. The old
/// entry implied a choice — no `elm.txt`, but Porter "is implementable".
/// Reading bwh16 again shows there is no choice to make, because
/// **BibleWorks' `=` is not the Porter mode.** The help is explicit:
/// "If you want to do a fuzzy link SEARCH without switching to fuzzylink
/// mode just precede your command line search with an equals sign."
/// Porter is one of three states of a right-click menu and is never
/// bound to a control character. So the character `=` has exactly one
/// meaning in BibleWorks, and it is the `elm.txt` one — a hand-edited
/// proprietary word list we may not ship. That half of the entry stands
/// untouched.
///
/// Which leaves the real question: should `=` be given a NEW meaning
/// here, now that the app has a stemmer? Three measurements say no.
///
/// * **BibleWorks' Porter mode is a query rewrite, and this grammar
///   already has the operator it rewrites to.** bwh16: "A wild card is
///   appended to the word before the search is done… 'eating' would be
///   replaced with 'eat*'." So `=.faith works` is `.faith* work*` and
///   nothing else. Over the KJV: `.faith works` finds 15 verses,
///   `.faith* work*` finds 23. A second spelling of a line the reader
///   can already type, returning the same 23.
/// * **On the edition this command line exists for, it would do
///   nothing.** Porter is a 20th-century algorithm and the KJV is not
///   20th-century English. `believeth`, `loveth`, `worketh`, `saith`,
///   `doeth` and `healeth` all stem to themselves, so `=.believeth`
///   would run `.believeth*` and return the same 39 verses as
///   `.believeth`. `fuzzy_search.dart` documents this hole rather than
///   patching it, for a good reason — a patched Porter no longer matches
///   the published vector it is tested against — and an operator whose
///   headline case is a no-op is worse than no operator.
/// * **It would be silently inert for the readers this app is for.**
///   Porter has no claim on Han text, so `=.爱 神` and `.爱 神` are the
///   same search. A control character that changes nothing for the
///   和合本 reader is `strip_chronology_layout.dart`'s "nothing narrows
///   in silence" rule facing the other way.
///
/// And a fourth reason that is about the shape of the app rather than
/// about `=`. The stem rung already exists, in `fuzzy_search.dart`,
/// behind a switch that is off by default and LABELS every row it
/// widens into ("word form"). A `=` operator would be a second,
/// unlabelled route to the same widening, inside the one grammar that
/// file deliberately does not touch. Two doors to one room is how one of
/// them stops being maintained.
///
/// So `=` is still refused — and the refusal is now accurate about what
/// was not implemented, and names the line that does the same job
/// (`cmdIssueFuzzyLink`). If `elm.txt`-style link data is ever licensed
/// or rebuilt, `=` is the character waiting for it.
///
/// ## Formerly on that list: `( )` compound searches
///
/// Shipped 2026-08-19 in `compound_query.dart` and wired through
/// `WorkbenchProvider`. The entry above outlived the feature by three
/// weeks, which is worth more than a one-line correction: a
/// "deliberately not implemented" ledger is only useful if it is true,
/// and a stale entry is how a second implementation gets started.
///
/// ## Formerly on that list: `@` Strong's tag binding
///
/// 2026-09-08. `.man@444` — "man, where the Greek behind it is
/// ἄνθρωπος" — is now parsed here and matched against the tagged text.
/// `strongs_tag_binding.dart` carries the rationale, the leading-zero
/// rule and the measurements. The two reasons this list used to give
/// were checked rather than overturned:
///
/// * *"it needs the tagged-text service"* — true when it was written and
///   no longer true: `services/tagged_text_service.dart` landed the day
///   before, and six of the twelve bundled editions now ship
///   `assets/tagged/<version>/<book>.json`, one run of rendered text per
///   original-language word.
/// * *"the app already has a different Strong's syntax in the same box"*
///   — still true, and still a design decision, but the two grammars
///   cannot collide positionally. `G25 AND G26` carries no leading
///   control character, so this parser answers
///   [CommandIssue.notACommand] and `WorkbenchProvider` passes the line
///   on to `parseStrongsBoolean`; `.man@444` opens with `.`, which that
///   parser has never accepted. What had to be decided was how a number
///   is spelled, and the answer is that both spellings are read into one
///   — see `normaliseStrongsTag`.
///
/// The honest-failure half is deliberately NOT here, because this file
/// does not know which edition is on screen. Six editions carry tagging
/// and six do not, and a `@` query against one of the six that do not is
/// **unanswerable, not empty** — `WorkbenchProvider.runSearch` refuses it
/// by name with [CommandIssue.strongsTagNoTaggedText] before any search
/// runs. [runCommandQuery] therefore asserts when it is handed a tag
/// query without the tagged tokens to answer it, rather than quietly
/// returning nothing.
///
/// ## Formerly absent entirely: the GSE's punctuation test
///
/// 2026-09-08. `'love *5 god %-` — "these two words within five, but not
/// across a sentence end" — is now parsed here and applied to the span a
/// phrase match occupies. `punctuation_gate.dart` carries what bwh19,
/// bwh21 and bwh22 actually say, the per-script character sets and the
/// counts behind them.
///
/// It was never on the list above, because it arrived attached to the
/// Graphical Search Engine and left with it: `docs/PARITY-BACKLOG.md`
/// §3.2 rejected the GSE **canvas** on 2026-09-07 — *"the DIAGRAM is
/// REJECTED, the power is not"* — and the punctuation test went out in
/// the same motion despite needing no canvas at all. It is one bit of
/// state plus an optional character set. This does not re-open §3.2; it
/// collects a piece of the power §3.2 explicitly kept.
///
/// Three things were deliberately NOT built, each for a reason:
///
/// * **`.` and `/` do not take it.** In BibleWorks the punctuation test
///   belongs to an ordering LINK between two word boxes; the merge box —
///   the AND/OR/NOT node — has no punctuation setting at all, only a
///   verse proximity (bwh21). Two words in sequence have one span and
///   "between" names it; a bag of words has several and no way to say
///   which. [CommandIssue.punctuationNeedsPhrase] says so.
/// * **Per-link control.** bwh21 lets every ordering box in a query set
///   its own mode and its own custom set. A command line has no way to
///   point at one link out of several without inventing a second
///   grammar, and the query that would need it — different rules for
///   different joints of one phrase — has no reader asking for it.
/// * **`@` cannot be combined with it.** A tag query reads its tokens off
///   `assets/tagged/`, which stores rendered runs and nothing between
///   them. There is no punctuation in that asset to test, so
///   [CommandIssue.punctuationWithStrongsTag] refuses the pair rather
///   than testing one corpus and matching another.
///
/// `strongs_proximity.dart`'s `G25 BEFORE5 G26` wanted this too and
/// cannot have it, for a reason that is a measurement rather than a
/// judgement — see the note in that file.
///
/// ## Deliberate divergences from BibleWorks
///
/// * BibleWorks treats input with NO control character as a reference or
///   a shortcut only — a bare word is never a search. SeekSparks keeps
///   its existing bare-text behaviour, because most of its readers have
///   never heard of a control character and taking their search box away
///   to be faithful to a manual would be a straight regression.
/// * BibleWorks forbids a `;N` verse context on a `'` lexical phrase
///   ("verse context limits are not permissible"), because its lexical
///   path is index-driven and cannot cross a verse. Ours scans, so the
///   restriction is an implementation artefact rather than a meaning, and
///   `'x y;2` is accepted and behaves as `;x y;2`.
///
/// Flutter-free on purpose: this parses and matches, nothing else.

/// 2026-09-05 (SeekSparks): what a plain search — a command line with no
/// control character — is allowed to match.
///
/// Until now it was a substring scan over the verse key with **every
/// space taken out**, on both sides. That rule is right for Chinese and
/// wrong for every other script this app ships, and the wrongness is not
/// a corner case. Measured on the KJV (31,102 verses), before this file
/// and after it:
///
///     query     before    after    rows that only ever held a word gap
///     forth      3,419      877    2,542   ("for the")
///     asa        1,301      207    1,094   ("as a")
///     heirs        369       24      345   ("their shoulders")
///     end        1,524    1,205      319   ("seven days")
///     oar          237      117      120   ("also a righteous")
///     for the    2,029    2,020        9   ("bringeth forth evil")
///
/// The `forth` and `asa` columns land on the 2,542 and 1,094 that
/// `docs/PARITY-BACKLOG.md` measured when it recorded this defect, which
/// is the check that this is the same bug and not a neighbouring one.
/// The last row is the direction nobody expects: stripping spaces let a
/// query that HAS a space match text that does not, so `for the` was
/// over-counting by 9 as well.
///
/// Nothing in those rows is markable — `search_highlight.dart` marks the
/// query's literal, and the literal is not in the text — so the reader
/// is handed a verse with a hit they cannot find. That is the whole
/// defect: **a match that steps over a word gap the reader never typed.**
///
/// ## The rule
///
/// A plain query matches where its characters occur in the verse in
/// order and next to each other, with two deliberate exceptions:
///
///   1. **Whitespace the reader typed absorbs any amount of whitespace
///      in the verse, including none.** This is what the old space
///      strip was really buying and it is kept: `the lord` still reaches
///      a verse that sets those words across a line break, `爱 神` still
///      reaches 爱神, and `in deed` still reaches "indeed".
///   2. **Whitespace in the verse may be stepped over only where Han
///      characters stand on both sides of it.** Chinese does not put
///      spaces between words, so a space inside a run of Han characters
///      carries no boundary and is noise — of which the 和合本 has
///      exactly 14 verses' worth (`cuvs-yhwh.json`, e.g. 玛拉基书 2:1
///      「这 诫命」 and 历代志上 21:20 「就和他 四个儿子」). Scripture
///      text is frozen, so the search layer steps over them rather than
///      the asset being edited — and those two verses are the proof the
///      exception is load-bearing rather than theoretical: without it
///      这诫命 falls from 4 verses to 3 and 就和他四个儿子 from 1 to 0.
///
/// Nine Chinese probes over both editions (爱, 神, 爱神, 起初, 神爱世人,
/// 这诫命, 就和他四个儿子, 「起初 神」, 雅伟) return an identical count
/// before and after this change; so do four Greek probes over `lxxwh`,
/// accented and unaccented. Only the space-separated false positives
/// moved.
///
/// Exception 2 is the entire script-awareness, and it is stated as a
/// property of the characters rather than of a mode the reader selects:
/// there is no Chinese branch and no locale check, and a verse mixing
/// 和合本 text with a Latin proper name gets the Latin rule at the Latin
/// seam and the Han rule at the Han seam, within one verse.
///
/// **What this deliberately does NOT change:** a match still may sit
/// inside a word. `walk` still finds "walked" — 390 verses before and
/// 390 after, where `.walk` read as a whole word finds 203 — and
/// `shalom` still finds "Jehovahshalom", 3 before and 3 after.
/// `docs/PARITY-BACKLOG.md` separates the two cases and
/// calls the within-word one "arguably wanted"; it is also the only
/// prefix search a reader who has never heard of `*` will ever perform.
/// A hit inside a word is markable and a hit across a gap is not, which
/// is the line this file draws.
///
/// Hebrew and Greek take the alphabetic rule. Both are set with spaces,
/// and both arrive here with their points and accents already folded
/// away by `foldDiacritics` (#321), so pointed and unpointed spellings
/// reduce to the same consonants before any boundary is looked at. The
/// Hebrew maqqef `־` is NOT whitespace and is not treated as one: it
/// joins its two words into a single run here exactly as it already does
/// in `related_verses.dart`'s tokenizer, so nothing about `כָּל־הָאָרֶץ`
/// changes in either direction.
///
/// ## 2026-09-08: the looser reading, and where it plugs in
///
/// [plainSearchMatches] now has two behaviours, and the switch between
/// them is `fuzzy_search.dart`'s single global — OFF unless a reader
/// asked for it. With it off, this file computes what it computed the
/// day it was written, character for character;
/// `test/fuzzy_search_test.dart` pins that with the same probes the
/// table above was measured with.
///
/// The insertion point is here rather than in `SearchService.scanText`
/// for a reason worth stating: **the corpus key and the query key are
/// built by the same two functions in this file**, which is what makes
/// them comparable at all, and any broadening that did not go through
/// both would be the silent asymmetry `search_folding.dart` warns
/// about. A rung that rewrites the query is applied here, where the
/// query is already folded, lower-cased and space-normalised, and
/// nowhere else.
///
/// Pure string work: no Flutter, no assets, no I/O.

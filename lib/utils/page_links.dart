// URL paths that name a full-screen PAGE rather than a passage.
//
// Most of the app's URLs are reader links — `#/<book>/<chapter>` — and
// `UrlSyncService` parses those into a book/chapter/verse and applies
// them to `MainProvider`. A handful of pages instead OWN the address bar
// while they are open (see `UrlSyncService.claimUrl`), and their paths
// are not passages at all. `#/wheel` is the first of them.
//
// A page path reaches the app by two different doors, and before this
// file existed only one of them knew about it:
//
//   • COLD OPEN. On the web the engine's boot route name IS the hash
//     path, so `Navigator.defaultGenerateInitialRoutes` asks
//     `onGenerateRoute` for it while it builds the first frame, and the
//     page is on the initial stack above the app root. (It used to be
//     PUSHED instead, from the root router's first post-splash frame —
//     which is why a shared wheel link showed a splash, then a
//     workbench, then a transition, and only then started loading the
//     wheel's own data.)
//
//   • A LIVE TAB. Editing the fragment in the address bar, or pressing
//     Back / Forward onto a `#/wheel` history entry, is a same-document
//     navigation: the web engine hands the framework `pushRoute('/wheel')`
//     instead of restarting the app. `/wheel` is not a registered route,
//     so that lands in `onUnknownRoute` — which used to answer every
//     unknown name with the app root, i.e. it pushed a SECOND workbench
//     at Genesis 1 on top of whatever was showing while the address bar
//     read `#/wheel`. The page link was a real page the whole time; the
//     fallback simply had no way to know that.
//
// Both doors now ask the same question here, so a page can never be a
// page through one and a stray URL through the other.
//
// 2026-09-02, one constraint the cold door imposes: the boot answer is
// given to `Navigator.defaultGenerateInitialRoutes`, which splits the
// boot path on `/` and asks for EVERY prefix. A page path with a
// sub-path — `/wheel/x` — would therefore generate `/wheel` AND
// `/wheel/x`, i.e. two wheels on the initial stack. Nothing emits a
// sub-path today (`claimUrl` writes `/wheel`, optionally with a query).
// If one is ever added, the boot door must match only the last segment.

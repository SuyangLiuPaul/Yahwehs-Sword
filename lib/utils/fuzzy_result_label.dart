/// 2026-09-08 (SeekSparks): the one line of this feature that is NOT
/// portable, kept in its own file so the rest can be lifted out whole.
///
/// `fuzzy_search.dart`, `porter_stemmer.dart`, `chinese_segmentation.dart`
/// and `search_synonyms.dart` know nothing about this app: no Flutter,
/// no assets, no `Verse`, no locale. They are going into the YsWords
/// repository unchanged. This file is where they meet SeekSparks — it
/// knows how a verse becomes a corpus key (`searchCorpusKey`), how a
/// query becomes segments (`plainSearchSegments` under
/// `foldSearchMarks`), which character starts a command line, and which
/// of three locales the reader is in. Every SeekSparks import this
/// feature needs is in this file and in no other, which is what "the
/// rest is portable" has to mean to be worth saying.
///
/// ## Why the label is built from the verse and not carried with it
///
/// `SearchService.scanText` returns a `List<Verse>` and no provenance,
/// and it is not this feature's place to change that signature: six
/// callers pass through it, and a per-verse "how did this match" field
/// would have to be threaded through every one of them to reach the one
/// list that draws rows. Instead the question is asked again, per
/// VISIBLE row, at the moment the row is drawn — the query's expansion
/// is memoized, so the second ask costs one pass over one verse, and a
/// `ListView.builder` never draws more rows than fit on a screen.
///
/// The rule it serves is the one this codebase has fixed three times:
/// a view that changes what it shows must say so. `strip_strings.dart`
/// states it as "nothing narrows in silence" for a filter that
/// subtracted; this is the same rule for a search that ADDED — a reader
/// who sees 约翰福音 1:42 in the results for 磯法 is owed the two
/// characters that say the verse actually spells it 矶法.

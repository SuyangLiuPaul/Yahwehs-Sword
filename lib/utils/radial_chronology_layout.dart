/// chronologies were being engraved long before any living publisher —
/// and it is all this file takes. The data underneath is ours
/// (`assets/wheel_history.json`, every nation carrying its verse), the
/// palette is the app's own line-of-descent hues, and no wording,
/// artwork or compiled table from any printed chart is reproduced.
///
/// THE GENESIS LIFESPANS ARE DRAWN HERE AGAIN, AND ON THE BC AXIS —
/// NOT ON A SECOND ONE. This file once carried an Anno Mundi half: one
/// ring per generation, each life an arc, the creation at twelve
/// o'clock. It went in `b75ffc6`/`2d1a66d`, and the reason it went is
/// still true and still binding — two axes on one circle point one
/// angle at two different years. What changed is the DATA, not the
/// drawing. Since the creation anchor was derived
/// (`bible_timeline.json` `_meta.creation`, 4114 BC: Thiele's Solomon
/// counted back along twenty-five stated intervals) every Anno Mundi
/// figure has one honest BC year, `creation + am`, and [buildLifeArcs]
/// draws the lives at those years through the SAME [angleForSpan]
/// every event uses. There is no AM geometry in this file and there
/// must never be: the conversion happens once, in the caller, out of
/// the one field that holds the anchor.
///
/// A SPOKE SAYS WHEN; AN ARC SAYS HOW LONG, AND ALONGSIDE WHOM. The
/// births of Genesis 5 and 11 are events with their own spokes. The
/// lives are arcs in the label annulus, and they carry the one thing
/// no event may state: that Methuselah's years run out in the year of
/// the flood — which the text nowhere says and the arithmetic does.
///
/// Angle convention is the canvas's: 0 rad points right (+x), positive
/// is clockwise because y grows downward. The axis starts at twelve
/// o'clock and runs clockwise through [sweepRad], leaving a gap wedge
/// before twelve o'clock again so the first and last rim labels cannot

/// CONSTANT length — `span * 0.36`, about 40 px, the same box whatever
/// the label said. Measured in the shipped faces over all 491 events on
/// a 700 px canvas at rest: **not one English title was drawn whole**,
/// 462 of 491 Chinese ones were cut, and 77% of the English characters
/// never reached the reader. What did reach them was
/// `Mosc…` for *Moscow Council Restores the Patriarchate* and `奧斯…`
/// for *奧斯曼境內基督徒遭驅逐與殺害* — a rim of stubs that names
/// nothing and reads as a broken chart.
///
/// So a label is now **legible or absent**:
///
///  * Chinese is whole or nothing. Every ideograph is a morpheme, so
///    two of them are not an abbreviation of ten, they are a different
///    word — 莫斯 is not 莫斯科. This is the standing rule (#297) that
///    a CJK label is never ellipsised, and the wheel is the surface
///    that broke it hardest.
///  * Latin may fall back to whole WORDS with an ellipsis, because
///    *Moscow…* still names something and *Mosc…* does not. If not even
///    the first word fits, nothing is drawn.
///
/// Nothing is lost by omitting text: the tick stays, so the event is
/// still visible and still tappable, and the band's own sheet lists
/// every event on that stream. The reader's lever is zoom, which shrinks
/// type against a fixed canvas and so buys real room.
///
/// [badge] — the `+65` of a spoke standing for a cluster — is reserved
/// BEFORE the title, and is the last thing given up. A title is one
/// event's name and can be recovered by zooming or by tapping; the
/// badge is the only mark on the whole wheel saying that sixty-five
/// other events are behind this one, and a chart that drops it is back
/// to narrowing in silence. So the order of sacrifice is verse, then
/// title, then badge.
///
/// It is set at [refSize] — the size the verse already rides this same
/// label at — for hierarchy, NOT for room. It buys no room worth having:
/// measured in the shipped faces, Chinese titles are quantised in whole
/// ideographs, so shrinking the badge from [titleSize] to [refSize]
/// recovers the same 22 of 48 at 700 px and the same 53 of 55 at 900 px.
/// (A one-space gap at 0.85 does recover 7 more at 700 px, and that is
/// exactly the kind of knife-edge not to build on — one space either
/// way, on one corpus, at one canvas size.) The reason is that `+65`
/// set in the title's own face reads as another word in the name; at
/// the verse's size it reads as an annotation on it, which is what it
/// is.
///
/// WHAT THE BADGE COSTS, measured in the shipped faces over the real
/// corpus at rest. English keeps every label — 48 of 48 at 700 px and
/// 55 of 55 at 900 px, badge or no badge — and an earlier version of
/// this comment read "English pays nothing at all" on the strength of
/// that. That is the count of labels DRAWN, not of names drawn WHOLE,
/// and English does pay: titles that fit with no ellipsis fall from 31
/// to 22 at 900 px and from 6 to 3 at 700 px. English pays in words
/// where Chinese pays in whole names, because Latin may cut at a word
/// and Han may not (#297): 55 Chinese titles become 53 at 900 px, and
/// 38 become 22 at 700 px. At 1400 px the badge is free in both — 79 of
/// 79, whole and uncut, either way — so the entire cost sits on the two
/// smallest canvases the wheel is reachable on.
///
/// Against that, the number of spokes saying NOTHING AT ALL falls from
/// 10 to 2 at 700 px, and 43 spokes that stood mute for their 400-odd
/// hidden events now say how many they stand for. A name the reader can
/// recover by zooming or by tapping is the cheaper thing to spend.

// constant — `rRim + 11`, alternating with `rRim + 22`, and `rRim + 17`
// — that knew nothing about the string it was positioning.
//
// A constant cannot be right here, and the reason is worth stating
// because it is not obvious: a scale label is drawn HORIZONTALLY, so it
// is not rotated with the ray it sits on, so how far it reaches back
// towards the wheel's centre depends on WHICH WAY THE RAY POINTS. At
// twelve o'clock only the label's height points inward; at nine o'clock
// its whole width does. Measured in the shipped faces over the real
// corpus, 主前2500 at ten past ten reached **12.3 canvas units inside
// the rim** and printed straight through the event titles ending there
// — 8 of the 12 century labels intruded at 900 px in Chinese, 192 of
// 432 across a 3-locale × 3-size × 4-zoom sweep, producing 113 pairs of
// overlapping ink. The photographed instance was 主前3500 mashed into
// 最早的轮式车辆, which is a *wheel-native* event at exactly -3500: a
// year that is a multiple of 500 puts an event's label at precisely the
// century label's own angle.
//

// support function of an axis-aligned box in the ray's direction, so it
// is exact rather than a margin somebody guessed.

/// for the whole of its [width] × [height] box to stay at least
/// [clearance] outside [rRim].
///
/// The box is axis-aligned — a year on a scale reads horizontally — so
/// its reach back towards the centre is `w/2·|cos| + h/2·|sin|`, which

// ── the arc labels, the last family no test could read ───────────────
//
// The rim's labels have been planned out here since phase 11. The band
// names and the arc labels were still decided inside the painter, where
// canvas text leaves no widget and no semantics node for a test to find
// — so both were measured in the shipped faces over the real 22 streams
// and 62 powers before anything was changed. The band names came back
// sound: rendered and read back pixel by pixel, no two adjacent rows'
// INK touches at 700, 900 or 1200 px in either locale, worst clearance
// 0.91 canvas units, and their size is already bounded when magnified.
// They are left exactly as they were.
//
// The arc labels were not sound. `.clamp(6.0, 10.0)` on top of the
// geometric cap made the FLOOR the binding limit — a 3.12-unit cap at
// 700 px came back out of the clamp as 6.0 — so a label was set at
// exactly 6.00 canvas units at every canvas size, every locale and
// every zoom. Three things followed:
//
//   * on screen the size was 6 x zoom: 48 px at 800%, beside rim
//     labels holding station at 10.5.
//   * the SET never grew. 26 of 62 English names at 900 px, the same 26
//     however far the reader zoomed in. The rule this page is built on
//     is that zooming shows MORE; here it showed the same, larger.
//   * at 700 px the ink of all 22 English and all 34 Chinese labels
//     drawn was 5.88-5.94 units tall in a ring pitch of 5.41 — they
//     printed across the neighbouring stream's row. That is what
//     overriding a geometric cap with a floor buys.
//
// The size now comes from the same two questions the rim answers, and
// the floor is kept but read in the units that make sense of it.

/// The smallest this wheel will put an arc label on the reader's
/// SCREEN, in logical pixels.
///
/// The number is not new: `.clamp(6.0, 10.0)` in the painter has been
/// the wheel's floor all along, and 6.0 is what it produced at every
/// canvas size. What changes is the units. As a floor on the CANVAS
/// size it was multiplied by the `InteractiveViewer` — 6 px at rest and
/// 48 px at 800% — and it could raise a size back over the geometry it
/// had just been capped by. As a floor on the SCREEN size it means at
/// rest what it always meant, and nothing absurd when magnified.
///
/// It is well under [WbMetrics.smallPrintFloor], the 11 px the app
/// holds its chrome to, and that gap is deliberate but unresolved:
/// 22 rings share 153 canvas units at 900 px, so no type that stays
/// inside a ring is 11 px at rest, and raising the floor to 11 would
/// take every arc label off the wheel until the reader zooms to about

// the streams drops the ring pitch from 6.95 to 4.8, so `fitArcLabel`'s
// cap (pitch x 0.9 = 4.3) falls under the 6 px floor and every one of
// the 62 power names goes dark at rest — the wheel's main content
// paying for a side layer. Shrinking the hub buys 6.3, cap 5.7, still
// under the floor.

// The annulus is the one region with room. It is 112 units deep at

/// Judah and Jehoahaz of Judah" against "86 arcs". Huldah is not a king

/// the fourth zero-width REIGN is Shallum of Israel; and counting only
/// the kings missed three zero-width ministries entirely. The 86 was a
/// stale count from before the ministries joined this band. Both errors
/// came from measuring a list assembled by hand instead of the one
/// `buildLifeArcs` returns, which is why the figures above are now taken
/// from that call.
///
/// So an arc's target is its own sweep OR a finger, whichever is wider,

/// CONTAINMENT BEATS PROXIMITY, and this is the one case the "nearer
/// centre" rule above does not cover, because it was written for
/// SIBLINGS — reigns packed by [buildSpanArcs] never overlap within one
/// ring, so at most one of them could ever geometrically contain a tap
/// and the old rule never had to choose between two that did. The power
/// bands added on 2026-09 are not siblings: `_buildArcs` on the wheel
/// page deliberately keeps every power in its stream on ONE ring rather
/// than sub-ringing (a stream ring is 6.95 canvas units at 900 px and
/// europe alone nests eight powers deep — eight sub-rings of that would
/// be 0.87 units, under any target this file defines), so a tap inside
/// the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem can land inside a pope's or a
/// crusade's arc as well. Scoring by normalised distance from centre
/// answered that wrong far more often than right: a pope's own `own` is
/// a few years wide against the kingdom's few centuries, so almost any
/// tap that was not dead in the pope's middle scored lower for the
/// KINGDOM and the reader asking for the pope got the kingdom instead.
/// So containment is now checked FIRST and separately from the score: of
/// every arc whose true, unpadded `[a0, a1]` actually contains [angle],
/// the NARROWEST wins outright, tie-broken by score when two are exactly
/// the same width. Only when no arc's true extent contains the tap —
/// which is exactly the hairline case the rest of this comment is
/// about — does the search fall back to nearest-centre-by-score among
/// every candidate a finger could plausibly have meant. Ties among
/// siblings, and every hairline arc's rescue by finger padding, are
/// untouched: this only changes the answer when two candidates'
/// genuine spans overlap, which packed siblings never do.
///
/// AND WHEN TWO SPANS ARE THEMSELVES IDENTICAL, the score tie-break
/// resolves nothing either, because score is a function only of the
/// span and the tap — two arcs with the same `[a0, a1]` compute the
/// same centre, the same `own` and so the same score for any [angle].

/// THE OUTLINE OF A CLAIM: the shape a hit answer is about, as a path.
///
/// 2026-09-17. Pulled out of the painter so its one decision can be
/// tested, because that decision was wrong in a way nothing could catch:
/// a target with no angular sweep was drawn as a CIRCLE whose radius was
/// the target's DEPTH, and for an event tick whose text label is drawn
/// that depth is half the radial run of the label. At 332% it put a
/// 270-pixel ring over blank paper — a picture of the claim that was not
/// the claim, which is worse than no picture, being the same lie the
/// plate used to tell but drawn on the chart.
///
/// Three shapes, one per kind of claim:
///
///   * a sweep and a depth  → the annular sector, which is the band
///   * a depth, no sweep    → a line along that one bearing, which is
///                            what a tick claims
///   * neither              → a small ring at the pointer's own scale,
///                            which is the only honest size for a mark
///                            with no extent of its own

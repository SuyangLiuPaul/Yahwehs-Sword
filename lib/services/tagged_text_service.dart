/// 2026-08-06 (SeekSparks): Strong's-tagged translation text.
///
/// Until now no translation SeekSparks shipped carried Strong's tagging,
/// so hovering a word in a translation line could only report the
/// *verse*. BibleWorks reports the *word* — its translations ship
/// tagged, and that tagging is part of its licensed data.
///
/// 和合本【雅伟】简体版＋ (修订编辑：孙树民) is tagged, and its publisher
/// cleared it for use here, so the Chinese column can now do exactly
/// what BibleWorks' English column does.
///
/// 2026-08-06: the Berean Standard Bible joins it. That mattered
/// because tagging was Chinese-only — an English reader hovering a word
/// learned nothing the verse number did not already tell them. The BSB
/// is public domain AND ships word-aligned to the WLC/Nestle base, the
/// rare pairing that lets an English column be tagged without licensing
/// anything. Built by `tools/import_bsb.py`.
///
/// Assets are built by `tools/import_yahweh_modules.py` into
/// `assets/tagged/<version>/<book>.json`, one file per book, loaded
/// lazily — the whole set is ~13 MB, far too much to hold eagerly.

  ///     renders no Greek word at all — the word it names is the one

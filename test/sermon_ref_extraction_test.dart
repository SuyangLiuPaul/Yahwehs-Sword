/// WHAT THE SERMON REFERENCE INDEX MUST NOT DO, and what it had been
/// doing.
///
/// `refs.json` is derived from the corpus by
/// `scripts/extract_sermon_refs.py`. Nothing in Dart re-runs it, so a
/// wrong rule in that script becomes a wrong link on the reader's
/// screen with nothing between. Three defects were fixed on
/// 2026-09-03, and this file pins each one from the shipped asset.
///
///   1. **"Mark 5" was not the Gospel.** Sermon 339 is "Seven Marks of
///      a Regenerated Christian" and its heading enumerated "Mark 5:
///      Does Not Sin (1 John 3:9); Mark 6…; Mark 7…" — the fifth, sixth
///      and seventh MARKS. The index filed the sermon under three
///      chapters of a Gospel it never opens.
///   2. **"Deuteronomy 43 times" was arithmetic.** So was "Is 50%
///      enough?", which is the verb `is` plus a percentage and reached
///      the index as Isaiah 50.
///   3. **A one-chapter book is cited without a chapter.** "2 John,
///      verse 7" is how the only citation form those five books have,
///      and the extractor required digits after the alias — so sermon
///      238, which is built on 2 John, reached the index with NO
///      references at all.
///
/// TWO REPAIRS WERE REJECTED UPSTREAM and are pinned here by example,
/// because a rejected repair that is not written down gets re-derived:
///
///   * "a bare chapter followed by a colon carrying no digit is a
///     label" — it fits 94 matches across the corpus and 91 of them are
///     genuine, because a colon before a quotation is how a preacher
///     cites: "Paul says in Romans 11: 'Note then the goodness…'". It
///     would have cost 44 real pairs to repair 3.
///   * "ignore `#` heading lines" — 19 genuine keys against the same 3.
///
/// The repair that was taken is per-verse and in the DATA: the
/// editorial heading spells its numerals ("Mark five"), so the
/// extractor — which needs digits after a book name — indexes nothing
/// there. No preacher's words were touched.

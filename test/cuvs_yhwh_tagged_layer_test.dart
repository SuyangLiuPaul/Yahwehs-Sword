// The 和合本雅伟版 tagged layer was printing its source's alignment codes
// as scripture.
//
// `assets/tagged/cuvs-yhwh/` is what the Browse pane draws and what a word
// tap answers with. The MySword module it is built from is hand-edited, and
// 133 of its 533,914 codes are damaged — a dropped bracket, a doubled
// prefix, a character typed into the middle of the code. The importer's
// regex knew only the well-formed shape, so it did not skip the damaged
// ones, it treated them as TEXT: 「他若<H518>行恶」 drew the code on screen,
// and because the code never split the run, 他若 carried H4672 — the number
// belonging to a different word.
//
// The suite stayed green through all of it, because nothing had ever asked
// this asset whether it contains anything that is not Chinese. That is the
// question these tests ask, and it is nearly free: a Chinese verse has no
// Latin letters and no angle brackets, so any that survive are the source's
// markup rather than the translation.
//
// Jeremiah 34:8 is why the Latin test earns its place alongside the bracket
// one. Its code had lost BOTH brackets — `的仆人WH853x<WH5650>` — so a scan
// for `<…>` could never have seen it.

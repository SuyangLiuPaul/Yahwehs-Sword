// assets/cuvs-yhwh.json (Simplified) and assets/cuvs-yhwh-tr.json
// (Traditional) are the same edition in two scripts, regenerated together
// by 49af9be. Nothing had ever asked them to agree. Deriving a

// every traditional verse found 7 of 31,102 disagreeing:

//   038001003 撒迦利亞書 1:3   a lone 說 inside the Simplified Bible,
//       against 9,538 说 elsewhere in the same file — a singleton, not a
//       recension: repaired.
//   040025020 馬太福音 25:20  那另外的的五來 — 的 doubled, 千 dropped, in
//       the Traditional file: repaired.
//   023033009 023040007 023040008 059001011 060001024  凋 (simplified) /
//       雕 (traditional) — systematic at 83 against 5, and left alone
//       for six days on the reasoning that repairing it would fabricate
//       a house-style spelling onto the other script. Settled
//       2026-09-14 by reading the published 和合本 at each of the five:
//       it prints 凋殘 / 凋謝, so the house style was a conversion
//       error and these five are gone from the list.

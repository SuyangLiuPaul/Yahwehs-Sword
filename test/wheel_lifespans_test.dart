  /// is narrower but its em box is squarer. All 25 are back at 1400 px
  /// and, at the smaller canvases, by 2x zoom.
  ///
  /// That is not a defect and it is not adjusted away: it is the rule
  /// the whole wheel runs on — legible or absent, and zoom is the
  /// reader's lever. What is pinned here is the MEASURED count, as a
  /// ratchet: it may rise as the corpus or the fitter improves, and it
  /// must never fall.
  ///
  /// A FLOOR, NOT THE RENDER. `canvasTextStyle` declares no
  /// `fontFamily` — the wheel's canvas type is the host's own UI face —
  /// so no test can measure exactly what a given reader sees. Roboto is
  /// the stand-in, as it is in `wheel_arc_label_behaviour_test.dart`,

  /// shipped build drew Moses and Aaron, which this count says are
  /// absent. These numbers are therefore a conservative floor under a
  /// real render, which is the direction a ratchet should be wrong in.
  ///

  /// two days, and both were asked for.

  /// going from eleven sub-rings to sixteen — a sub-ring from 9.73 px
  /// deep to 8.69 at 900 px, 6.69 at 700. THE ANNULUS took 74
  /// church-history and 42 Roman and Greek records, of which 29 are
  /// EVENTS, and an event is a spoke: 29 more radial labels that an
  /// arc's name has to find room beside.
  ///
  /// What that has cost, cell by cell, against the 25 Genesis names:
  ///
  ///     700 en        21 -> 20   Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Aaron, Moses
  ///     700 zh-Hans   24 -> 24   only Jacob
  ///     900 en        23 -> 21   Jacob, Joseph, Aaron, Moses
  ///     900 zh-Hans   23 -> 21   Abraham, Isaac, Aaron, Moses
  ///     1400 en       25 -> 23   Aaron and Moses
  ///     1400 zh-Hans  25 -> 25   every name
  ///
  /// **EVERY NUMBER ABOVE IS AT REST, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE OF IT.**
  ///
  /// I first wrote here that 1400 px had "stopped being the guarantee
  /// that nothing is permanently lost" and that something had to give
  /// before another layer could be added. That was wrong, and wrong in
  /// the direction that would have stopped work for no reason. Measured
  /// afterwards: `fitArcLabel` alone places all 25 at 1400 px and 22 at
  /// 900, and at ×2 zoom it places all 25 at BOTH. The names these
  /// cells lose are lost to SPOKE COLLISIONS — `placeArcName` dodging
  /// the event labels crossing the arc — and a small magnification
  /// clears them, because the legibility floor is `floorPx / zoom` and
  /// the spoke declutter's own gap is `onScreenPx / labelScale(zoom)`.
  /// Both layers already re-lay out as the reader zooms; that is not a
  /// feature waiting to be built.
  ///
  /// So what these floors measure is the RESTING view, and an arc that
  /// loses its label at rest is still tappable, still selected by
  /// search, still named in its own sheet, and one pinch away from its
  /// label. `the names all come back with a small zoom` below is what
  /// keeps that claim honest, and `the strong floors still hold with
  /// the ministries off` keeps the resting view from being spent
  /// without anyone noticing.
  /// 2026-09-03, and THE BIGGEST CANVAS LOST THE MOST, which is the

  /// The zoom-recovery test below was re-run and still passes: all 25

  // 2026-09-15: `700 zh-Hans` 24 → 22, and the two characters are a
  // consequence of the band annulus being widened, not of anything
  // going wrong.
  //
  // The bands used to have 17% of the radius and the event titles the
  // outer 55%. Giving the data its room moves the rim outward, which
  // makes MORE event titles plannable at 700 px — and a planned spoke
  // title is exactly what a Genesis name has to dodge. So three lives
  // (Jacob, Aaron, Moses) lose the draw at the smallest canvas in
  // Chinese, where the names are widest.
  //
  // Accepted rather than tuned away: all 25 are still listed in the
  // stream's own sheet, the arcs are still tappable, and the trade is
  // the one this whole pass is about — the chart's data getting the
  // radius that its annotation had taken. The falsifier below (20 of
  // 25) is untouched and still guards the real floor.
  //
  // `900 en` 21 → 20 later the same day, from the other half of the
  // work: 31 events were added to the ancient end of the chart, so
  // there are more planned spoke titles for a Genesis name to dodge.
  // Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph and Moses are the five that lose the
  // draw at that canvas in English, and Abraham, Joseph, Aaron and
  // Moses at 1400 (`1400 en` 22 → 21). They are exactly the men whose
  // arcs sit in the crowded Ur-to-Exodus centuries, which is where the
  // new Mesopotamian and Egyptian bands landed — so this is the new
  // data being visible, not the old data being lost.
  //
  // Note what did NOT move: both Chinese floors. Chinese names are two
  // or three characters where 「Abraham」 is seven, so they were never
  // the ones competing for the room, which is a small confirmation that
  // the cause is width and not something structural.
  //
  // `700 en` 20 → 19, 2026-09-15, and the cause is the type going from
  // 10.5 px to 12.5 「字体感觉太小」. A wider name needs more arc, and
  // Moses — seven characters in the crowded Ur-to-Exodus centuries — no
  // longer gets it. One name, bought with two points on every label on
  // the chart, and the trade is the right way round: the 25 lives are
  // all still in the stream's sheet and all still tappable.
  //
  // What this table now measures has also narrowed, and honestly it
  // should be read that way. Only the SELECTED life prints its name on
  // the canvas since the same day; these floors measure the CAPACITY
  // the planner still has to find that one label a size and a place.
  // They are kept because that capacity is real and can still be spent
  // by accident — not because 19 names are on screen.
  //
  // 2026-09-21: the two English cells drop again, and the cause is the
  // AXIS this time, not the type. 「创世是12点钟方向」 with
  // 「一半的位置应该是0年」 puts the chart's start at twelve and year 0 at
  // six, which is half a turn apart — so BC holds exactly 180° of the
  // dial where a single-rate axis gave it 215.9°, and every Genesis arc
  // is 17% shorter in ANGLE than it was. The short lives are the ones
  // that stop fitting their own name: 700 en 19 → 18 (loses Moses),
  // 900 en 20 → 18 (loses Aaron and Moses).
  //
  // Recorded as the real cost it is. Measured the same day, the other
  // four cells are unmoved — 700 zh-Hans 23, 900 zh-Hans 22, 1400 en 19,
  // 1400 zh-Hant 24 — and the falsifier below, under 20 of 25 in Chinese

    // of the arc's midpoint, tapped there, and asserted the LIFE sheet
    // opened rather than the event's. It was defending the owner's
    // report 「我要按那个环而不是字」 — labels were taking the arcs' taps.
    //
    // That scenario can no longer be built, and the reason is the
    // change this file was updated for: unselected records stopped
    // printing names on the canvas, so there is no drawn title left to
    // cross anything. Instrumented before rewriting rather than
    // assumed — the hunt found zero candidate pairs at every zoom it
    // tried.
    //
    // A test that cannot construct its scenario proves nothing, so it
    // must not be left passing vacuously. What replaced it is the
    // invariant that makes the scenario impossible, and it is worth
    // pinning because removing it is a ONE-LINE, INVISIBLE regression:
    // `_handleTap` reserves `label.rStart..rEnd` for every spoke, and
    // on the day the names came off the canvas that line became an
    // invisible bar across the annulus, still taking taps from the arcs
    // underneath it for text nobody could see. It was live for about
    // twenty minutes.
    //
    // The rule: the tap follows the ink.
    // 2026-09-17: THE GUARD IT USED TO PIN WAS A PROXY, and it stopped
    // standing for the thing. It read `drawsName = wheelShowsEventText(
    // zoom, selected)` — "are record names on at this zoom" — which was
    // the same question as "is THIS name drawn" only while every record
    // that could be named was. The detail table ended that: most names
    // are now dropped for room, and each dropped one went on claiming
    // its corridor. 「鼠标在下面为什么上面highlight了？」

    // because `label.rStart..rEnd` comes from the planner and the
    // painter places the plate from the tick outward.
    //

    // those. The rule is unchanged and is now literally true: THE TAP
    // FOLLOWS THE INK. `wheel_hit_accuracy_test`'s 'a record answers for

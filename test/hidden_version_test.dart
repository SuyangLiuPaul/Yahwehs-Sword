/// 2026-09-02: the NASB is hidden from the interface.
///
/// The owner's instruction was 只从界面藏掉 — take it off the interface,
/// not out of the build.
///
/// **The LEB was hidden alongside it for a few hours the same day and is
/// visible again.** The owner checked its licence and it permits what
/// this app does; only the NASB's permission is still an open question,
/// and it is open with the publisher rather than here. The pair were
/// hidden together because the question had not been asked, not because
/// the answers matched — so the LEB is not in [_hidden] and appears
/// below only as the control that proves the hiding is narrow. That is a
/// narrower change than a removal and it has a narrower failure mode,
/// which is what this file is for.
///
/// [_hidden] has grown twice since, both on 2026-09-08 and both for the
/// superseded-by-a-divine-name-edition reason rather than the NASB's
/// licensing one: `cuvs-plus` in the morning and `bsb` in the
/// afternoon. Their notes are on [_hidden] itself. The two halves below
/// are unchanged and are what every entry has to satisfy.
///
/// Two halves, and both have to hold:
///
///   1. Nothing OFFERS them. The picker, the Browse stack sheet, the
///      Browse nav strip, the command line's version verb, the Copy
///      Center, the split-pane seed, the first-run Browse stack and every
///      locale default all read `availableVersions`, so hiding is one
///      line — but only as long as no surface reaches past it to the raw
///      catalog. Two did (`command_pane`, `browse_nav_strip`), which is
///      why this is pinned rather than assumed.
///
///   2. Nobody is STRANDED on them. A version code outlives the reader's
///      choice of it: `nasb` is in SharedPreferences, in synced `lastRead`
///      blobs, in persisted Browse stacks, in saved Copy Center options
///      and in every `?v=nasb` link ever shared. Every one of those has to
///      land on a Bible the reader can also find in the picker — and,
///      where the reader chose English on purpose, an English one.
///
/// The assets themselves are untouched and still ship;
/// `test/data_integrity_test.dart` is what pins that, and this file
/// deliberately re-states it so the two halves of the decision cannot
/// drift apart without one of them failing.

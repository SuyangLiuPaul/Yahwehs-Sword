/// THE FIRST REAL CRASH REPORT THIS APP HAS EVER RECEIVED, reproduced.
///
///     Bad state: No element
///     Version 1.6.204   Platform web   Locale en   Route /wheel
///     05:48:35.965Z nav:push  /
///     05:48:35.965Z nav:push  /wheel
///
/// Source-map-deobfuscated against a rebuild of `20e3d36` (the commit
/// that shipped v1.6.204), the frames read:
///
///     js_array.dart:469          JSArray.single
///     scroll_controller.dart:173 ScrollController.position
///     scrollable_positioned_list.dart:543/559 _startScroll
///     scrollable_positioned_list.dart:526     _scrollTo
///
/// — `_positions.single` on a `ScrollController` that has no positions.
/// In debug that is the framework's `_positions.isNotEmpty` assertion on
/// line 171; release compiles the assertion out and `.single` throws
/// instead, which is the message the reader saw.
///
/// The two breadcrumbs share a millisecond and are the `[home, wheel]`
/// initial stack `af9d956` introduced — shipped in this very version. So
/// the reader cold-opened a shared `#/wheel` link and never navigated
/// again; the Browse pane they crashed in was one they never saw.
///
/// What makes that possible is the difference between BUILDING and being
/// LAID OUT. The Overlay lays out only the entries above the last opaque
/// one, so the workbench under the wheel is never laid out — but it is
/// still built, and it keeps building, because a descendant's `setState`
/// does not need layout. So the pane mounts, loads its chapter, and
/// builds its `ScrollablePositionedList`, whose `initState` attaches the
/// `ItemScrollController`. `isAttached` is now true. The scroll POSITION
/// is created by the `Scrollable` inside the list, and that lives under a
/// `LayoutBuilder`, which never runs. `isAttached && positions.isEmpty`
/// is the state the app had never been in before, and the post-frame
/// scroll-to-the-focused-verse walks straight into it.
///
/// The test is written against the real `BrowseWindow` under the app's
/// real `appGenerateRoute`, so what it pins is the shipped path and not a
/// model of it. Falsified by reverting `_listIsLaidOut` to `isAttached`
/// alone: it fails with exactly the frames above.

/// The splash has to hand over. This file exists because it stopped
/// doing so, in prod, on phones — the v1.6.56 report was "the app sits
/// on the splash forever" — and 1400-odd green tests said nothing.
///
/// The trap is a one-shot flag. `LoadingPage` arms a 3 s timer that
/// hands control to the app, and it may only arm it once the verses are
/// actually loaded. v1.2.28 added a build-time safety net that marked
/// the one shot as spent BEFORE checking whether there was anything to
/// hand over, so the ordering below — first build with the boot still in
/// flight, verses arriving afterwards — burned the shot on a no-op and
/// nothing ever re-armed it.
///
/// That ordering is the NORMAL one on a phone: `main.dart`'s 4 s splash
/// watchdog mounts this page whether or not the active version has
/// finished downloading, so a cold cache or a slow connection lands here
/// every time. On a warm desktop the verses are already in hand when the
/// page mounts, which is why no test and no screenshot ever caught it.

// Where the chronology wheel's SCALE is printed, measured in the faces
// the app ships.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The wheel has four families of words and three
// of them already have a guard: the rim labels since phase 11
// (`wheel_label_legibility_test`), the arc labels since phase 12
// (`wheel_arc_label_behaviour_test`), the band names measured and left
// alone in the same pass. The fourth — the century ticks and the two
// axis ends, which are not data but the SCALE — had none, and was
// placed by a bare constant that knew nothing about the string it was
// positioning: `rRim + 11`, alternating with `rRim + 22`, and
// `rRim + 17`.
//
// A constant cannot be right, because a scale label is drawn
// HORIZONTALLY and so is not rotated with the ray it sits on: at twelve
// o'clock only its height points back towards the centre, at nine
// o'clock its whole width does.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE CAUGHT. These assertions were run against the old
// placement before it was replaced — the whole file, with only the two
// constants and `centuryTickLabel` swapped back. Six of the fourteen
// went red, and this is the size of the thing they were red about,
// over 3 locales x 3 sizes x 4 zooms = 504 scale labels:
//
//   * 210 of 504 reached inside the rim; 396 came closer to it than
//     the clearance the fix now guarantees. Worst: 主前2500 at 900 px,
//     12.3 canvas units inside.
//   * 113 pairs of scale-label and event-label ink actually overlapped.
//   * 7 pairs of scale labels overlapped EACH OTHER — every one of them
//     AD 2000 against the AD 2026 axis end, 26 years and 1.4 degrees
//     apart, which is why `kAxisEndSwing` is 0.10 and not the 0.055 it
//     was.
//   * AD 1000 / 主后1000 was CLIPPED off the left edge of the canvas at
//     700 px in all three locales — it sits at 175 degrees, so its
//     whole width points outward along the horizontal.
//   * The origin tick printed `AD 0` / `主后0`, a year the reckoning
//     does not have, and `parseWheelYears` dutifully returned [0].
//
// The photographed instance was 主前3500 printed through 最早的轮式车辆,
// and the reason that pair and not another is arithmetic: an event whose
// year is a multiple of 500 sits at exactly a century tick's own angle.
// Two of the 491 do.
//
// The instrument is a separating-axis test between the two boxes, not a
// radius comparison, because a radius comparison cannot tell a label
// that reaches inside the rim WITH an event under it from one that
// reaches inside the rim with nothing there. Only the first is a defect
// a reader sees; both are worth fixing, and this file asserts both
// separately so a regression says which one came back.

/// 2026-09-05: the plain-search word-boundary rule, pinned against the
/// real editions.
///
/// A plain command line (no control character) was a substring scan over
/// a corpus with its spaces removed, so KJV `forth` listed the 2,542
/// verses that say "for the" and marked nothing in any of them. The fix
/// is in `lib/utils/plain_search.dart`; this file is the evidence that
/// it bites in English and that it does not touch Chinese.
///
/// Every count here was measured, not chosen. If one moves, the engine
/// changed and the number in `plain_search.dart`'s header is now a lie
/// as well.

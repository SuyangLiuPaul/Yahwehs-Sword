/// 和合本雅偉版 繁體, at the 128 character classes the published 和合本
/// settles — and at the places where it settles them two different ways.
///
/// This edition has never had a Traditional master. Ours and the
/// publisher's are two conversions of the same Simplified text, so where
/// they disagree at a character neither side's own consistency is
/// evidence. 和合本雅偉版 is the 和合本 with the divine name restored, so
/// the printed 和合本 is the same sentence and answers the question;
/// every position below was read verse by verse at 信望愛
/// (bible.fhl.net, `VERSION4=unv`) on 2026-09-14, 922 chapters of it,
/// and applied by `tools/apply_cuv_tr_hehe_verdicts.py` from
/// `tools/cuv-2026-09-14-hehe-verdicts.tsv`.
///
/// **The reason this file exists is the per-occurrence rule.** 和合本 is
/// not internally consistent, and the temptation on a list of 128
/// "classes" is to settle each class once and sweep. It writes 槓 for
/// the poles at 出埃及記 25:13 and 杆 for the same poles at 27:10; it
/// writes 茍合 and then 苟合 inside one verse of 以西結書; three verses
/// carry a pair the other way round from every other verse in the Bible.
/// A class-level verdict would have corrupted every one of those, so
/// each is pinned here by the words around it.
///
/// The refutations matter as much as the repairs: the Hong Kong glyph
/// ruling below this, and the three verses the back-conversion still
/// cannot see, are both things a later sweep would "fix" wrongly.

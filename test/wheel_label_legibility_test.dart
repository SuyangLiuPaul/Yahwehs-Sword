// What the chronology wheel's rim can actually say, measured in the
// faces the app ships.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every word on the wheel is drawn with a
// `TextPainter` onto a canvas. No widget sweep can see it — there is no
// `RichText` node, no semantics label, nothing a `find.text` can reach —
// so for as long as the painter decided what to draw, the one decision
// that matters (is this label legible?) sat in the one place no test
// could read. It was wrong, and had been since the wheel shipped:
// measured over the real corpus on a 900 px canvas at rest, NOT ONE of
// the 55 English labels was drawn whole, and 46 of the 55 Chinese ones
// were ellipsised — which the standing rule (#297) forbids outright,
// because 莫斯 is not an abbreviation of 莫斯科, it is a different word.
//
// The fix moved the decision out of the painter into `planRadialSpokes`,
// which returns the resolved strings. This file reads them.
//
// `flutter test` otherwise lays every glyph out in a fixed-width
// stand-in face, which would make a fitting test pass while proving
// nothing about the shipped build. The fonts are loaded for real, and
// the control at the bottom fails if that ever stops working.

    // and a real regression to constant boxes undercuts to 0, so a
    // generous margin still fails loudly on the bug this guards.
    // 2026-09-03, AND THIS IS A REGRESSION AT REST, SAID PLAINLY.

    // the declutter is angle-limited, so a denser corpus does not add
    // spokes, it puts MORE events behind each one, and the `+n` badge
    // that says so is bought from the title's room.
    //
    // THE FLOOR HAS NOW MOVED TWICE IN ONE DAY, 4 -> 9 -> 10, and that
    // is worth saying out loud rather than burying in a number: the
    // corpus grew about 40% today and the rest state pays for all of it.
    // Measured at 900 px, Chinese: 68 spokes / 66 whole / 2 mute before
    // any of it, 69 / 60 / 9 after the first 137 records, 72 / 62 / 10
    // after the last 59.

    //   x2.0   1      x2.5   0      x3.0  0
    // So one spoke out of eighty-five waits for a second step of zoom.
    // That is a real cost and it is charged here rather than hidden.
    //
    // The next batch of records should not simply move this number
    // again. If the rest state needs to hold more, the declutter is what
    // has to change.
    //
    // 2026-09-15, AND THIS IS THAT BATCH — 10 -> 14. The instruction
    // above was followed before the number was touched, and the result
    // is worth recording so nobody repeats the experiment.
    //
    // 31 events were added to the ancient end, on the owner's
    // instruction 「世界的图早期很多都没有 … 可以有些大家比较知道熟悉 有
    // 故事 有出处的 … 也可以加进去放那里」. Before 1000 BC the chart had
    // held 43 events for three and a half millennia.
    //
    // THE DECLUTTER WAS CHANGED FIRST, and separately: the page divided
    // its angular gap by the live band radius, so widening the band
    // annulus the same day made the gap smaller and drew MORE spokes.
    // It now divides by a fixed proportion, which is right on its own
    // terms — the gap is about labels colliding in the outer annulus,
    // not about how thick the rings are.
    //
    // THEN CLUSTERING HARDER WAS TRIED, and measured, at 900 px in
    // Chinese:
    //   1.35x  76 spokes / 62 whole      1.45x  72 / 58
    //   1.55x  68 / 56                   1.65x  breaks the 1.5x
    //                                           recovery (76 < 80)
    // It does not help. `spokes.length - 10` falls exactly as fast as
    // `whole` does, because a mute spoke is one whose `+n` badge took
    // the room its title needed, and clustering harder makes MORE
    // spokes carry a badge, not fewer.
    //
    // AND THE BADGE WAS NOT OVERRIDDEN. Letting a Chinese title outrank
    // its badge would have passed this test immediately; it is refused
    // because #297 settled that the badge is the only mark saying a
    // spoke stands for more than it names, and a chart that narrows in
    // silence is a worse fault than one that narrows visibly.
    //
    // So the tolerance moves, with the reason attached. The real answer
    // is the one the design research points at and which this file
    // cannot reach on its own: label sets computed per zoom BUCKET, so
    // the rest state stops trying to label everything and spends its

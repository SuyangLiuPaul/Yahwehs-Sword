"""Defects in 和合本雅偉版 that only the official 和合本 could settle.

WHY THESE EXIST AT ALL
----------------------
This app's copy of the edition is **99.1% the publisher's current text**
(30,834 of 31,102 verses, measured against their own edit log). That is
the right place to be — it is their edition. It also means that where
their current text is wrong, we ship it wrong, and nothing internal to
this repo can tell the difference between their reading and a defect.

So the owner's ruling decides: 「参考和合本繁體官方的去决定」 — consult
the official 和合本繁體. The witness is the plain 和合本繁體 (耶和華, not
雅偉), 31,103 verses, kept in the Yahweh's Words repository's history at
git blob **7a2dc43** and spot-checked against bible.fhl.net
(VERSION1=unv), where it agrees character for character.

Every entry below was read there first. Every one was also found in
Yahweh's Words on the same day and fixed there by the same reading:
the two apps carry the same edition and neither should carry it wrong.

WHY EACH IS ANCHORED TO ITS VERSE
---------------------------------
Never a global substitution — a rule that fixed 五壳 by rewriting 壳
would also rewrite every shell in the Bible. A correction that came
from reading one verse is applied to that verse.

# OPEN, AND NOT DECIDED HERE
# --------------------------
# This edition holds **6,217 enumeration commas and the official holds
# 6,349**. 出埃及記 39:24 reads 「用藍色紫色朱紅色線」 where the official
# prints 「用藍色、紫色、朱紅色線」 — a list of three colours with no
# separator. Yahweh's Words had an older copy that still carried them
# and could restore from its own history; this app has no such baseline,
# so putting 132 marks back means taking them from another edition, one
# at a time, and that is a pass of its own with the owner's eye on it.
# Recorded here with the measurement so it is a known gap, not a
# surprise.

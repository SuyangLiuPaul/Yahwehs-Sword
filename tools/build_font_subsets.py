"""Build the bundled font subsets in assets/fonts/.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Flutter web's CanvasKit only draws glyphs that are in its Skia font
registry. When a code point is covered by no registered font the ENGINE
(not this app's Dart) fetches a Noto face from `fontFallbackBaseUrl`,
which defaults to https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/. That host is not
reachable from mainland China, and CanvasKit renders a missing font as
*absent text* — not tofu — so the failure is silent and total.

Measured on dev v1.6.62: opening a Hebrew word study pulled
notosanshebrew, notosans, notosanssymbols and notosanssymbols2 from
fonts.gstatic.com. Bundled Roboto has 922 code points (Latin, Cyrillic
and *monotonic* Greek only) and NotoSansSC-Sub covers CJK, so the gaps
were: the whole Hebrew block, the whole of Greek Extended (U+1F00-1FFF,
i.e. every accented word in the Greek NT and the LXX), the Semitic
transliteration diacritics, and a handful of UI symbols.

BibleWorks authored and shipped its own BWHEBB / BWHEBL / BWGRKL fonts
rather than trusting the host machine. Same principle: a tool whose
subject is Hebrew and Greek bundles the faces that render them.

WHAT IS BUNDLED, AND ON WHAT RULE
---------------------------------
Everything a reader *reads* — scripture, lexicon, transliteration and
the search syntax shown in the command line's own help. Decorative
iconography is left to the platform, because bundling a monochrome
symbol face would replace the colour emoji that iOS and macOS already
draw. The line is visible in the data: the decorative glyphs in
`assets/bible_evidence.json` carry U+FE0F (emoji presentation); the
load-bearing ones do not.

  NotoSansHebrew-Sub    Hebrew + Hebrew presentation forms, BY RANGE
  NotoSansExt-Sub       polytonic Greek, combining marks, Latin
                        Extended Additional, spacing modifiers, BY
                        RANGE, minus everything Roboto already has
  NotoSansSymbols2-Sub  five text symbols, BY LIST
  NotoSansSC-Sub        CJK, BY SCAN of this repo (union-only)

The script blocks are subset BY RANGE, not by the characters that
happen to appear in today's assets, because Hebrew and Greek are also
*input*: a reader can type ἀγάπη or אהב into the command line, and a
scan-derived subset would blank on the first form no asset contains.
The CJK subset stays scan-derived because the full face is 16 MB.

NEVER SHRINKS
-------------
Every subset is unioned with the cmap of the file already in
assets/fonts/, so re-running this can only add coverage. The previous
script (tools/build_cjk_font_subset.sh, removed) scanned
/Users/pliu0036/Documents/yswords — the fork *parent* — so it had been
subsetting against the wrong repo's text, and 384 characters that
appear in SeekSparks assets (assets/strongs/thayer_zh.json,
assets/strongs/bdb_zh.json, the zh-TW sermons) were missing from the
bundle.

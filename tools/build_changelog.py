"""Turn the git history into the changelog the app ships.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-09-09 the owner asked for release notes in
the app — 「也要有历史的release note但是不要全部的」. The finding was
that there were none to show: all 270 GitHub Releases carry the same
body, `Automated Linux x64 build. Download the tarball...`, written by
the Linux job of `release-android.yml`. That is build instructions for
one platform, not a note, and it is identical on every release.

The notes were in the commit subjects the whole time. This app writes
them as sentences — "A retired edition is announced once, not on every
launch", "versions: plain BSB comes off the interface, and the English
default with it" — which is already a changelog, so nothing here
rewrites them. It selects.

WHAT IS DROPPED, and why each one is bookkeeping rather than a change
the reader can see:

  * `release: vX.Y.Z to dev + prod` — the mechanics of shipping. There
    is one per version, so leaving them in would make the changelog
    half release lines.
  * `PROJECT_STATE: …` and `docs: …` — this repository's own record.
    Real work, none of it visible in the app.
  * `chore:` / `ci:` / `test:` — the same, one level down.

WHY THE SPINE IS THE `release:` COMMITS AND NOT THE TAGS. Tags were
the obvious choice and are wrong here: `tag_release.sh` only started
pushing them on 2026-09-08, so the repository holds **12** tags for
270 versions. Built on tags, the oldest entry swallowed the entire
history back to the initial commit — 719 notes in one row, 51 KB.
Every released version does have a `release: vX.Y.Z …` commit (older
ones read `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`), all the way back, so those are
the anchors.

WHY IT IS A BUNDLED ASSET rather than fetched. The GitHub bodies for
every EXISTING release are the boilerplate above, so an app that read
them would show an empty history until enough new releases accumulated
— the reader would ask for the changelog and be told there isn't one,
which is worse than not offering it. Generating from git gives a full
history on the first build, and gives it offline, which matters for a
Bible app used on a tablet with no SIM.

HOW MANY, and why the first two answers were both wrong. The owner's
constraint was 「不要全部的而是足够的不然太多」. The first guess was 20
versions; measured, this app ships **29 versions in three days**, so 20
is a day and a half and reads as a broken page. The second guess was 30
"because that is three to six weeks" — measured, it is three days.

The measurement that settled it: **120 versions is 115 entries, 250
notes, 25 KB, and one month** (2026-08-11 → 2026-09-09) spread over 17
days. Size was never the constraint — 25 KB is nothing to bundle. The
constraint is the reader's scroll, and the thing that makes a changelog
here unreadable is not the notes, it is **115 version numbers**. So the
notes are all kept and the page groups them BY DAY: seventeen headings
instead of a hundred and fifteen rows. Throwing away history would have
been solving the wrong half.

Versions whose every commit was filtered out are dropped rather than
shown empty. Everything older than the window stays on GitHub, which
the page links to.

THE BUILD'S OWN VERSION (review finding 1, 2026-09-09). Anchoring on
`release:` commits has a hole at the top: that commit is written AFTER
the build it names has been deployed, so the asset baked into v1.6.272
could only ever reach v1.6.271. The page's 「你的版本」 badge compares
against the running version and therefore never rendered, and "what's
new" was always one version behind — on a page whose whole purpose is
the top entry. So the top entry is now SYNTHESISED: `--head-version`
(the just-bumped pubspec version; read from pubspec.yaml when absent)
names it, and its notes are every commit after the most recent
`release:` anchor up to HEAD — exactly the commits the release commit
will span once it exists. If the anchor for that version is already
in the history (a `--no-bump` re-run, or a regenerate after the
commit) it is folded in rather than listed twice. The asset records
which version it was built for under `head`, so a test can prove the
generator ran after the bump and not before.

Usage:
  tools/build_changelog.py            # write assets/changelog.json
  tools/build_changelog.py --check    # print, write nothing
  tools/build_changelog.py --head-version 1.6.272 --head-date 2026-09-09

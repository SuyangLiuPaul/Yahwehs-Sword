"""Derive every in-app brand mark from the one master, and check the rest.

Why this file exists
--------------------
`assets/app_icon.png` is named as the master in three places —
pubspec's `flutter_icons.image_path`, `tools/generate_themed_icons.py`
and `tools/generate_site_icons.py` — but nothing ever enforced that it
held the current drawing.

It did not. The sword mark reached the shipped launcher icons in
dc146fc, and its hilt was fixed in b6d9859, but neither commit touched
the master. Two consequences, both live until this script landed:

  * the loading screen, which loads `assets/loading.png` directly, still
    showed the pre-rename SeekSparks mark — a dark ground with an open
    book and gold sparks, no sword at all; and

  * every generator downstream of the master was one run away from
    reverting all six platforms to that same retired drawing. Nothing
    would have failed; the icons would simply have changed back.

So the master is now the drawing, and everything derived from it is
produced here rather than by hand. `test/brand_marks_test.dart` fails
when any output drifts, which is the part that stops a fourth repeat.

The launcher icons themselves are NOT written here — `dart run
flutter_launcher_icons` owns those — but they are checked, because
leaving them out is how the home-screen icon kept the old drawing
through a --check that reported all clear. If that command has to be
run, revert `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` afterwards: it
rewrites every activity-alias icon to the default and quietly collapses
the six alternate icons into one.

Usage:
    python3 tools/generate_brand_marks.py            # write the outputs
    python3 tools/generate_brand_marks.py --check    # verify only, exit 1 on drift

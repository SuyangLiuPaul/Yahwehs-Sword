# Single-command web release for SeekSparks.
#
# Unlike YsWords (which this was forked from), SeekSparks ships ONE
# international build only — no CHINA_MODE bundle, no cn-* sites (see
# the fork plan's "explicitly deferred" list). Just dev + prod.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/release_web.sh                   # build, deploy dev (NO bump)
#   tools/release_web.sh --bump            # bump the patch version first
#   tools/release_web.sh --include-prod    # ALSO push to seeksparks prod (REQUIRES user OK)
#
# THE VERSION DOES NOT MOVE FOR A DEV DEPLOY. 2026-09-16 「除非我叫你
# release和prod push 否则版本号码不要变 sword和words都是一样」. The
# version number is the owner's release marker, not a progress counter:
# the in-app update check and the changelog both read it, so a version
# that moved without a release tells every user something shipped when
# nothing did.
#
# Which left dev builds indistinguishable from each other, so 「Dev 可以
# 有：123这样在最后」 — a dev build shows `1.6.310.12`, where the last
# number is the commits since the last `v*` tag. It is derived, not
# stored: nothing to bump, nothing to forget, and it cannot disagree
# with the tree it was built from. It goes ONLY into the displayed
# version (`--dart-define`), never into pubspec — `version.json`, the
# APK's versionCode and the update check all go on reading the plain
# release version, and `UpdateService._parse` takes the first three
# segments, so `1.6.310.12` compares as 1.6.310 wherever it is compared.
#
# A run with --include-prod is a RELEASE and carries no dev suffix.

# 2026-09-09: the release time is NOT computed here, and must not be.
#
# The comment that stood here said APP_RELEASE_TIME "was never passed,
# so kAppReleaseTime kept falling back to a hand-edited default" — and
# then the next line computed one and passed it, which is the opposite
# of what the paragraph argued. Both halves were out of date:
# tools/bump_version.sh has stamped kAppReleaseTime's defaultValue into
# app_version.dart since v1.3.59, precisely so that "builds no longer
# need to pass APP_RELEASE_TIME at all" (its own words).
#
# Passing one anyway gave a version TWO release times. The APK from
# release-android.yml, the iOS build and the checked-in source all read
# the stamped constant; only web read this `date`. On a `--no-bump`
# re-cut — which docs/release-policy.md's prod step is — they diverge by
# however long is between the two runs, and the About page's "last
# updated" disagrees across platforms for one version number. That
# disagreement is the exact symptom v1.3.59 introduced the stamping to
# end.

# 2026-09-09: refresh the bundled changelog before the build, or the
# app ships a "What's new" page that stops at whenever somebody last
# remembered to run the generator by hand.
#
# AFTER the bump and BEFORE `flutter build`, and told which version it
# is building for (review finding 1, 2026-09-09). The earlier comment
# here argued the opposite — that the version being released "has not
# shipped" and so belonged off the page. That was wrong from the
# reader's side: they open "What's new" ON this version, the page's
# badge marks the running version, and with the entry missing the
# badge never rendered and the top of the page was always one release
# stale. The generator synthesises this version's entry from the
# commits after the last `release:` anchor, which is exactly what the
# release commit made after this deploy will span.

# web` already emits the same files into build/web/canvaskit/; this
# flag just makes the bootstrap use them, off our own origin.

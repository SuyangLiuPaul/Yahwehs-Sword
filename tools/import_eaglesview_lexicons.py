"""Eagle's View's name dictionary and Thayer's lexicon -> assets/.

Two small reference sets that SeekSparks does not carry:

  BNames.dct  2,622 Bible proper names with their meanings — "Aaron: a
              teacher; lofty; mountain of strength". Hitchcock's Bible
              Names Dictionary (1869), public domain.
  Thayer.dct  5,913 entries of Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon (1889),
              public domain. BibleWorks ships Thayer too, so this one is
              a gap in SeekSparks rather than an edge over BibleWorks.

Both are public domain; supplied here via Eagle's View, credited as such.

BNames is plain text. Thayer is RTF-ish — `\\par` for breaks and the odd
brace group — so it gets unwrapped rather than shipped raw, which would
put literal backslash-par through the reader.

    Four of the 5,799 entries keep a stray brace afterwards (G251, G3765,
    G4434, G5342). Those are source typos — a group opened with `{` and
    closed with `]` or `)` — so no brace matcher can pair them. Left as
    they are rather than papered over with a blunt `{`-strip that would
    also eat legitimate braces elsewhere.

    Note on counts: an earlier survey put this table at 5,913 rows. That

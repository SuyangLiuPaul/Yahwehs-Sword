The English book name is canonical (used by the Flutter
`resolveAndPrepareJump` which looks up `verses.firstWhere(book == X)`
post-`translateBookName`). Chinese references in zh-CN / zh-TW bodies
are mapped through the same alias index `parseReference` uses.

Run from repo root:
    python3 scripts/extract_sermon_refs.py            # rewrite the asset
    python3 scripts/extract_sermon_refs.py --check    # is it up to date?
    python3 scripts/extract_sermon_refs.py --out /tmp/refs.json

`--check` rebuilds in memory and compares against the committed asset,
naming what moved and exiting non-zero on any difference. `--out` writes
somewhere else, so the output can be inspected without touching the
shipped file — the two things this script needed and did not have while
it was quietly failing to reproduce its own asset.

# way: "Acts chapter 5", "Romans chapter 8 verse 14", "in Matthew
# chapter 6, verses 25 to 34". A punctuation-only separator cannot see
# any of those, so eight references the corpus states outright were
# invisible to this script. `refs.json` holds them because whatever
# generated it could read the spoken form; every regeneration since has
# silently dropped them.
#
# Only the whole words are admitted, never `ch.` or `v.`. Requiring the
# word means a match needs a token that no ordinary sentence puts
# between a book name and a number, and the corpus does not abbreviate.
#
# The comma and the word `and` are admitted only in front of `verse(s)`
# — never on their own between book and chapter, where "in Mark, 12
# disciples" would become Mark 12. `and` earns its place: the corpus
# says "Luke chapter 4 and verse 18" as readily as "Luke chapter 4,
# verse 18", and without it those sites match only as far as the
# chapter and file the sermon under a whole chapter when it named one
# verse. That is not a false positive but it is the wrong key, and it
# was 168 of them.
#
# The range tail is deliberately left as it was. A bare number with no
# book in front of it cannot match this pattern at all, so the "to 34"
# of "verses 25 to 34" is inert whether it is consumed or not, and what
# is recorded is the head — `Matthew 6:25`, which is exactly what the
# committed asset holds for 038. Same for "verses 12 and 13" (339) and
# "verses 1 and 2" (314): heads only, asset agrees.

#
# The gap allows the apposition a preacher actually speaks: "2 John, the
# Second Letter of John, verse 7". It may not cross a sentence, which is

# The lookahead after the alias is NOT decoration. REF_RE needs no

#
# `refs.json` is derived, and nothing used to notice when it stopped
# matching what it is derived FROM. The corpus was edited after the
# asset was written, the asset kept the references the edit removed,
# and the next person to run this script would have deleted them
# without a word. That is the failure this stamp exists to make loud.
#
# FNV-1a is a change detector, not a security hash: no adversary is
# being modelled, and the only property needed is that a different
# input gives a different number. It is spelled out here — rather than
# reached for from a library — because the guard that reads it back is
# `test/sermon_refs_up_to_date_test.dart`, which runs in CI where
# Python does not, and `crypto` is only a transitive dependency of this
# project. Fourteen lines of arithmetic in each language beats a new
# direct dependency for a checksum.
#
# The generator's own source is digested alongside the corpus, so
# editing the extraction rules also marks the asset stale.
